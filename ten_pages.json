In a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Ficci President Sangita Reddy also made a case for the need to create a self-sufficiency fund for innovation, construction and manufacturing clusters to make use of the emerging opportunities in the wake of disruption in global supply chain.The fund can be provided in tranches in the medium term, she said.Seeking an \"immediate support\", Reddy said the problem being faced is largely that of liquidity, and immediate release of money stuck in refunds and other government payments to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh crore will immensely help tide over the crisis.\"This may have already been provided for in the budget,\" she said.Further, additional fiscal support is required for vulnerable communities over and above the sum provided for in the Garib Kalyan Yojana announced earlier.Fiscal support is also needed for MSMEs in order to help them get back on track. Besides, funds are needed for upgradation of healthcare infrastructure to effectively deal with the current situation and for support to sectors like aviation and tourism that have been hit hard due to the lockdown.\"Additional fiscal support required at the current juncture for this purpose is about Rs 4.5 lakh crore,\" the letter said.The fiscal support sought includes \"small amount\" of Rs 10,000 crore towards proposed COVID-19 liquidity bridge required to give comfort to banks to restructure/ provide additional loans to large companies whose balance sheets have been impaired due to the virus outbreak, it added.\"Government may need to provide for about Rs 30,000-40,000 crore as a guarantee to banks over a 4-year period and in the current year, it can provide about one-fourth of that amount.\"This small amount will have a huge positive impact on these companies and their supply chain that includes several small and medium sized vendors, which otherwise may not survive the current crisis,\" the chamber said.The central government had imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 25 to check the spread of coronavirus.

{"heading": ["ICICI Bank Q4: All eyes on what COVID-19 does to the economy"], "sub_heading": ["An uncertain business environment certainly presents risks going ahead not just for banks but all industries."], "time": ["Last Updated : May 09, 2020 08:40 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["Moneycontrol.com"], "article": ["ICICI Bank\u2019s March-quarter numbers offer us two quick takeaways. One, the COVID-19 uncertainty is developing as the next big risk factor for all banks. In the quarter ended March, ICICI Bank has made a Rs 2,725 crore provision to cover the likely risks from COVID-19 lockdown. Provision refers to the money set aside by banks to cover risky loans.During a conference call post the Q4 results release,the ICICI Bank management was cautious in giving guidance on growth. That\u2019s understandable. The management, just like everyone else, is unsure on how the COVID-19 scenario will play out. An uncertain business environment certainly presents risks going ahead not just for banks but all industries.ICICI Bank can\u2019t be an exception.The overall tone of the management is that COVID-19 scenario will have an impact on the business. The Rs 2,725 crore provision, they said, is the result of the assessment at \u00a0the current stage.Two, the Yes Bank episode has not impacted large private banks as it has done to some of the smaller private lenders, from where depositors have moved out. For ICICI Bank, both the loans and deposits have grown at industry rates. Overall, considering the operational environment, ICICI Bank has come with a good set of numbers in Q4. The bank has managed a 12 percent growth in average current and savings account (CASA) deposits in Q4 with average CASA ratio at 42.3 percent.Term deposits grew by 29 percent year-on-year. With general risk aversion in financial markets, there is a likelihood that big, strong banks will see further deposit inflow continuing in moths ahead.Despite higher provisions, ICICI bank reported a 26 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 1,221.36 crore in quarter ended March 2020. Asset quality has improved with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances falling 42 basis points sequentially to 5.53 percent. Gross slippages stood at Rs 5,306 crore at the end of March 2020, rising 21.6 percent compared to Rs 4,363 crore in December 2019.Growth in the performing domestic corporate portfolio was about 9 percent year-on-year. Total advances of the bank increased by 10 percent year-on-year to Rs 6, 45,290 crore at March 31, 2020 from Rs 5,86,647 crore at March 31, 2019. Here again, if COVID-19 lockdown prolongs and economic activities slows for a longer period, ICICI Bank will find it tough to maintain even the current level of loan growth rate.The Hin Leong exposure of $100 million (about Rs 760 crore) along with an exposure to a healthcare firm in West Asia (the bank didn\u2019t disclose the names and details) have been tagged as NPA and been provided for already. So these exposures won\u2019t be a worrying factor for the bank and investors in the next quarter.Ultimately, what needs to be watched is the asset quality going ahead. According to the management, 32 percent of the customers (in terms of value of loans) have applied for loan moratorium. This includes borrowers from across categories including SMEs, retail borrowers and large corporations. \u201cEven some of the good borrowers (with sufficient cash flows) have opted for moratorium because everyone wants to prefer cash in this environment,\u201d said Sandeep Batra, President, ICICI Bank.But, COVID-19 is a great source of uncertainty. If the situation worsens, the likely impact will be first felt on low-rated companies, and then others. A closer look at ICICI Bank\u2019s loan book shows that At March 31, 2020, the fund-based and non-fund based outstanding to borrowers rated BB and below was Rs 16,668 crore. This is the segment of borrowers needs to be watched for asset quality issues going ahead."], "tags": "#Business#Companies#earnings#Economy#ICICI Bank"},

While Akhtar was working as an air-conditioner technician in Mumbai and earning about Rs 12,000-15,000 a month, he was unable to save any money due to the high living costs in the city. He found a job at a chemical factory at his home state but is now worried about the sudden change in labour laws.\u201cWe may be forced to work overtime and be still paid a pittance. This company I work at manufacturers chemicals used in making disinfectants. We barely get any safety equipment as protection and work more than the daily shift. Now the condition could get worse but I have no other choice,\u201d said Akhtar to Moneycontrol.Akhtar is among 450 million informal and contractual workers in India who may face a tough time amidst dilution of labour laws in states like , , Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and  among others.While the idea of the state governments is to boost economic activity that has seen a sudden dip due to the  (COVID-19) outbreak, both  and human rights activists are questioning this move.The idea here is to increase the work hours and also dilute laws related to industrial disputes and occupational safety so that corporates can \u2018get back to work\u2019 and avoid disruptions. But the pertinent question here is that should the country force-start economic activity by pushing workers to a tougher work condition with barely any rights against exploitation and measly pay?A  said that Labour and Employment Ministry pointed to 47 worker injuries and three deaths occurring every day in factories across India. With dilution of labour laws, the injuries owing to worker fatigue and overwork will only climb steeply.With no responsibility being placed on companies to uphold worker rights and safety, mid-sized and smaller entities are expected to take full advantage of the COVID-19 situation and make 12 hour shifts in factories and construction sites the new normal.Workers wouldn\u2019t have any rights to protest employer decisions related to retrenchment, payment of overtime wages nor would be able to set up/join labour unions.Several state governments are planning to pass ordinances giving employees virtually a \u2018free-hand\u2019. Workers may be forced to work long hours without breaks and in unsafe environments. Also, lawful organisation of workers through labour unions to protest ill-treatment of staff would also be outlawed.Realistically speaking, a worker at a construction site could be forced to report to work even if he/she is unwell and may be sacked if they go on leave or complain about inadequate safety gear.Worse still, workers would be at the mercy of the respective industry/site owner who could hire and fire at their will. For migrants and daily-wage earners with no source of income, these conditions could be the new normal as they would be forced to accept all regressive terms and conditions.While there is a dire need to reform archaic labour laws in the country, there is a set constitutional process that needs to be followed. Unification of the 13 labour laws is in process by the central government and is in the right direction to bring a single code for wages and worker safety. But, abrupt dilution of labour laws to suit industry needs is not viable and will affect productivity in the long term.Agreed that COVID-19 has presented India with a tough choice between starting up, resuming production and maintaining minimal infection spread, but opening up cannot be at the cost health and basic rights of of several million workers.If economic productivity has to come at the cost of the health and safety of the 450 million strong workforce working in small and big industrial units across India, the state governments may need to ponder if this is worth the risk."], "tags": "#Business#Economy#HR"},
{"heading": ["Why 14.7% unemployment rate doesn't capture the true state of the coronavirus economy"], "sub_heading": ["The true unemployment rate may be closer to 19.5 percent, the government said in a note attached to its report."], "time": ["Last Updated : May 08, 2020 08:10 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["Reuters"], "article": ["The US economy shed 20.5 million jobs in April, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent, a government report Friday showed.But these grim numbers -- both slightly less horrible than economist expectations - don't capture the staggering impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the workforce in the world's largest economy.The true unemployment rate may be closer to 19.5 percent, the government said in a note attached to its report.And that figure does not even count people whose hours were cut sharply due to the virus, or who couldn't look for work because of stay-at-home orders.The unemployment rate is part of a monthly report from the federal government's Labor Department, showing how many people don't have jobs as a percentage of the overall American workforce. The \"jobs report,\" as the release is known, provides two important labor market yardsticks: that unemployment rate, generated by a survey of households, and nonfarm payrolls, from a survey of businesses.The unemployment rate has long been an indicator of the health of the economy, shrinking when jobs are plentiful and rising when times get hard.A 14.7 percent unemployment rate means that nearly 15 people out of every 100 who want work don't have jobs. That is a lot more than the 4.4 percent rate in March.But as many as 7.5 million unemployed people were probably misclassified in as being employed, the report said, and millions more wanted to work but were not even classified as being in the labor force.Here is what the \"jobless\" report does and doesn't show:Many US workers who lose their jobs are eligible for weekly payments to help tide them over until they find their next job.These payments, which workers and employers fund, are known as unemployment insurance benefits. Some 33.5 million people have filed for them since mid March, when states first began imposing stay-at-home orders, weekly data published Thursday shows.\u00a0That is about one out of every five workers in the United States.But that doesn't mean the economy has 33.5 million jobs fewer than it did then, because even during a severe recession, some employers - supermarkets or delivery truck drivers right now - are still hiring. There have been three jobs added for every 10 layoffs, a recent Atlanta Fed survey.The unemployment claims only count the layoffs. Friday's report shows the net change in jobs.The unemployment insurance claims do not reflect every job lost in the United States, because not everyone who loses their job is eligible for unemployment insurance. There have been long delays in some states for processing claims, and the claims do not count until they are processed.Confusing matters further, businesses that got loans under the government's $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program may have hired back some people who had previously filed for unemployment benefits. And some states such as California, the country's largest by population and GDP, let people file an unemployment claim if their hours were cut, even if they did not \"lose\" their job.The Labor Department publishes six measures of unemployment, based on its survey of households. The main one is technically called U-3, and to qualify you need to be both out of work and looking for a job to be counted. That is the one that rose to 14.7 percent on Friday.A broader measure of unemployment, called U-6, captures people who are not counted in U-3, like those working fewer hours than they would like, or who looked for work in the past but just not recently.Last month this rate jumped to 22.8 percent, from 8.7 percent in March.Even that broader measure does not tell the whole story of who is not working right now.While the unemployment rate is supposed to capture people furloughed due to the pandemic, the report said that many such people were misclassified as employed but just absent from work - a category that is usually very small and includes mostly people on parental leave or on vacation.Adding back those people into the ranks of the unemployed, the report said, generates an unemployment rate of 19.5 percent, not 14.7 percent.The unemployment rate also misses people who lost their jobs but cannot look for or do work because of stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of COVID-19. If you aren't looking for work, you aren't counted among the unemployed. The government noted there were 9.9 million people who wanted a job but were not counted in the labor force.A pair of economists at the Chicago Fed recently crunched the numbers and found that accounting for such people could lift the real unemployment rate in the United States by several percentage points above and beyond the U-6. An immediate estimate of this higher wasn't yet available Friday."], "tags": "#Business#Economy#United States#World News"},

And India hasn't been an exception to this crisis, with the Indian economy likely to witness a contraction this year,\" CII said in a report.A substantive stimulus is required from the government in the form of support to the poor and to the industry, especially MSMEs, it said, adding that the pandemic itself is expected to persist till the time a cure or a vaccine is found, which may be 12-18 months away.\"The recovery process is also expected to take around two years, at the least. Therefore, the fiscal stimulus is needed immediately,\" said CII.In order to finance the broad elements of the stimulus package laid out above, the industry body suggested Rs 2 lakh crore support from the subscription of government paper by the RBI, taking into account that inflationary pressures remain muted in view of depressed demand conditions.An equivalent amount of Rs 2 lakh crore can be borrowed by the government from secondary market, so that bond yields remain moderate, CII suggested.A substantial reduction in expenditure of around Rs 4 lakh crore is also possible by reducing some of the discretionary expenditure such as centrally sponsored schemes.These are some avenues that would finance the package, it said. \"With economic activities being restricted for over 50 days now, the negative impact on the economy is expected to be even more significant than what we had earlier anticipated.This needs to be offset by a large fiscal stimulus so that jobs and livelihoods are protected. CII recommends the government to announce an immediate stimulus package of at Rs 15 lakh crore, which translates into 7.5 percent of GDP,\" CII President Vikram Kirloskar said.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said the broad elements of the stimulus may include cash transfers amounting to Rs 2 lakh crore to JAM account holders, in addition to the Rs 1.7 lakh stimulus already announced.\u201cA key fall out of this economic slowdown would be the human cost in terms of loss of jobs and livelihoods, which need urgent government intervention\u201d, said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII.He said it should be ensured that the migrant labourers are kept within the purview of the proposed cash transfers.In order to provide enterprises the immediate support to pay salaries to their workers and avoid any job losses, CII has suggested a provision of Rs 2 lakh crore for additional working capital limits to be provided by banks, equivalent to April-June wage bill of the borrowers, backed by a Government guarantee, at 4-5 percent interest.To support the estimated 63 million MSMEs which have been battered by the pandemic, CII has suggested a credit protection scheme for MSMEs whereby 60-70 percent of the loan should be guaranteed by the government, i.e. if the borrower defaults, government should repay the bank up to the amount it has guaranteed, so the risk to the lender is limited.This will encourage the banks to lend to the ailing sector so that their working capital needs are met, the industry body argued.In addition, CII has suggested the creation of a fund or SPV with a corpus of Rs 1.4-1.6 lakh crore which will subscribe to NCDs/Bonds of corporates rated A and above.The fund can be seeded by the government contributing a corpus of Rs 10,000-20,000 crore, with further investments from banks and financial institutions.This will provide adequate liquidity to industry, particularly the stressed sectors such as aviation, tourism and hospitality, CII said.In order to create a significant multiplier impact on boosting demand in rest of the sectors and enhancing long-term productivity, funding public infrastructure has been found to be a potent option.In this regard, we suggest an allocation of Rs 4 lakh crore be made on a public works programme that will create job opportunities, said the industry body.It suggested that the works should be initiated with the involvement of state governments, so that implementation bottlenecks can be overcome. Specifically, the spending can begin with the completion of projects that have already begun, such as roads which are stalled after 80 percent of the job is complete.CII has also suggested an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore to be earmarked for bailing out state-run electricity distribution companies that have been accumulating losses and burdening the state-exchequer.Further, to protect our financial sector for meeting the credit needs of the real sector, as well as absorb some shocks from potential insolvencies in the real sector, an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore for bank recapitalisation is required, it said, adding that this will help public sector banks manage any surge in their NPAs.\u201cClearly, time is running out for a fiscal stimulus package to rescue the economy. Delayed fiscal relief for enterprises reeling under the lockdown will make it harder for them to recover,\" Banerjee said."], "tags": "#Business#CII#coronavirus#Economy#India"},

Corporates are hiring talent to select roles\u00a0that\u00a0require specialised certifications in niche skills across business segments.Moneycontrol gives you a lowdown on the top 10 skills in demand across Indian corporates in times of COVID-19:Python is the second most loved programming language, according to StackOverflow developer survey, and for a reason. It is easier to learn, efficient and is usually the programming language taught in schools and colleges.So it is one of the most preferred languages for data scientists, Artificial intelligence and machine learning experts due to its flexibility and simplicity across the sectors.According to UpGrad blog, an edtech platform, Python developers\u2019 salary is high across the world as tech majors such as Google and Facebook are adopting Python. The blog states that an average data scientist salary is about Rs 7 lakh per annum and with experience it could go as much as Rs 17 lakh.It is another programming language that is more in demand. According to monterail.com, one of the reasons for the demand is that it is used for building data-intensive real-time Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications. Executives \u00a0Moneycontrol spoke to recently, said that IoT-based products and services are one of the focus areas for IT services firms.Node.js is an open-source server environment that runs on various platforms such as Windows, Linux and Unix for executing Javascript (JS). JS is a language used for creating webpages and is used across firms such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook.It is hardly a surprise that mobile development is one of the skills in demand. From booking cabs to buying groceries, everyone is going app-based and this would only accelerate as we are moving towards a touchless future. This means that mobile app developers for Android and iOS will be all the more in demand and companies will be more than happy to pay for them.Maneesh Sharma, Country Manager, GitHub India, a platform for the developer community said, flutter, a platform for building mobile applications, is one of the most popular for developing mobile applications.They are paid well too. According to an app developer, they can earn anywhere between Rs 50,000 for freshers and Rs 16 lakh, after a decade of experience in app development.Unlike a few years back, UI or UX design has gained importance as the focus has shifted to user experience with clients more willing to pay for it. An IT executive working for a banking client said that while the company has not changed the backend, which is more complex, there is more focus on building UI to make it more customer-friendly.\u201cSo, the focus is now on how to make it easy for everyone to access and how many steps does it need to complete a transaction. The fewer the steps, the better,\u201d added another executive. The recent influx of app culture and tendency towards ease of use has only accelerated the demand for improved UL/UX design.According to PayScale, the average salary of a UX designer is Rs 6.92 lakh per annum.Be it the regular schools and colleges or educational-technology companies, COVID-19 has made it mandatory for the course curriculum to move online. A digital curriculum developer is involved in designing a web-friendly content curriculum for institutes, corporates and individuals. Certification in web design, learning management software and basic video editing skills would come handy for this job role.HR firms told Moneycontrol there is a 25 percent year-on-year increase in demand for this role in FY21 due to the lockdown. The average salary ranges from Rs 5.6 lakh per annum to as high as Rs 15 lakh for niche corporate programmes.An allied area to this field is instructional designer where a target audience is identified and their skill gaps are looked at. Post this, relevant courses and skills are recommended to this group. The average salary for an instructional designer in India as per PayScale is Rs 5.3 lakh per annum.With the majority of India Inc working from since March 25 due to the COVID-19 lockdown, data privacy and information security/protection have been under threat. To deal with this, companies across sectors are hiring privacy officers in their teams. Certification in information privacy from recognised institutes would be necessary for landing a job.The job roles for this skillset include chief privacy officers and support staff. Human resource officials estimate that the country would need at least 1,000 chief privacy officers (CPO) over the next 8-12 months to meet the needs of corporates.Paid a handsome salary of Rs 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh per month, the chief privacy officer\u2019s job role is to ensure privacy for the data of staff and clients/customers. The company privacy policy implementation is in the hands of the CPO who is also involved in maintaining the confidentiality of the information and also ensure compliance.With the rise in concerns about future risks in the financial sector and how it would be managed, the role of actuary is in high demand. India with a population of 1.3 billion people has only 460 fully qualified actuarial professionals.The actual demand for fully qualified actuarial sciences professionals in India is more than three times the supply. However, a lack of awareness of the career opportunities and students dropping out midway has led to the low number.The starting salary of an actuary could be Rs 7 lakh which can go up to Rs 30 lakh with the number of years of work experience. Sectors like banking, insurance and broking firms employ actuaries.A digital project manager runs projects to build websites and mobile apps through discovery, planning, production, deployment and maintenance.Considering the shift in business strategies of companies from physical to digital due to COVID-19, digital project managers are in high demand.A project management course with certification in Six Sigma, Agile and DevOps can help individuals land their dream jobs in sectors like IT, online retail and e-commerce.The average salary in this role according to HR experts is Rs 15 lakh to 24 lakh per annum.Individuals with a certified financial risk manager (FRM) qualification are in high demand in the risk management teams of financial institutions, be it banks, investment firms, insurers and mutual funds. FRMs are involved in managing investment risks, trade risks as well as liquidity risks and market risks. During a tough market condition, FRM helps the investment team with the strategy in managing financial prudence.Clearing the FRM examination (Part 1 and 2) is a must for individuals seeking senior roles within risk management teams of companies. Individuals need to have two years of relevant work experience after passing the FRM examination to become a qualified Certified Financial Risk Manager.The average pay package of an FRM in India ranges from Rs 9 lakh to 12 lakh per annum.Salesforce, the customer relationship management service (CRM) provider is considered among the most advanced CRM technology in the world.

Few can say, though, whether it will derail a surge in which stocks logged their best monthly gain in three decades in April despite weak economic data from the previous month.\"The market has shown an ability to look through the economic data. I think it will continue to do that for the April data,\" said Doug Cohen, managing director for portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors.The parade of April data kicked off on Friday, when the Labor Department reported the US economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs that month, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression. Though bleak, that number was smaller than analysts' expectations of 22 million jobs lost.Two key data points next week include retail sales and industrial production, due on Friday, May 15. The numbers could help investors gauge the effect of closures on sales and factory output, said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics.Economists polled by Reuters expect retail sales to tumble 10\u00a0percent in April, surpassing the record drop of 8.4\u00a0percent in March. Industrial production, which slipped 5.4\u00a0percent in March, is forecast to fall 11.6 percent.Steep drop-offs like those are concerning to investors who worry that unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and US government have led markets to shrug off the economy's massive slowdown.US stocks have rallied even as Citigroup's US economic surprise index, which measures whether key economic indicators are coming in above or below forecasts, has tumbled to multi-year lows.Recent gains could wilt if US states need to roll back efforts to reopen their economies and unemployment fails to decline in coming months.\"Markets are suffering from cognitive dissonance,\" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist for MFS Investment Management, which manages about $470 billion in assets.\"Even if you reopen economies... you are not going to have economic normalisation in the second or third quarter.\"Big gains in technology and communications stocks led the Nasdaq Composite to erase all its year-to-date losses on Thursday. Rebounds in beaten-down sectors like energy have helped push the S&P higher in recent days.\"A pause (in the stock market rally) may not be surprising but the momentum trade is to continue higher as reopening of the country accelerates,\" said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management.Some recent economic data has also eased from the jarring levels of several weeks ago, though they remain weak by historical standards.Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits decreased for the fifth straight week to 3.169 million for the week ended May 2. That compares with 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.Still, much depends on the path the pandemic takes in the coming months.

You have two million people out of work. It's also they worked for a lot less hours than they normally would. This is still consistent with a really, really sharp drop in output or another big decline in overall economic activity in April.\"There are some (hopeful signs). Statistics Canada was reporting a larger share of the unemployment increase was in temporary layoffs, so workers are maintaining some contact with their employer and if their employer is still in business, planning to reopen once the shock is over. And also there are some green shoots out of other data ... so the depths of the downturn that we are hitting is unprecedented, but it does also look like we are getting to the bottom of that economic downturn.\"\"I think consensus was very heavily influenced by some of the gargantuan numbers we'd seen from the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, which indicated more than 7 million Canadians had applied for that relief.\"The number does make sense in that it's not wildly different from what we saw in the US, at least on the US payroll number. What that suggests is the two economies are seeing a roughly similar performance in terms of how much of the economy is being shut down.\"\"It's encouraging just on face seeing fewer jobs lost than we had feared. The unemployment rate at 13\u00a0percent is not something to be excited about but it's a lot better than feared. I would say that the jobs figures probably understate the weakness in the economy, given that you've got hours worked outpace fallen employment.\"(The Bank of Canada has) already deployed all their large asset purchase programs they had in the toolkit, and there's no real point to guidance if no one's pricing in a hike for well over a year ... If it turns out that the peak shock from social distancing measures was on the lower side of estimates, it doesn't imply less of a gap in the economy if you will, and it perhaps implies a little bit earlier of a return to normal. But that's not a 2020 discussion, it's probably not a 2021 discussion either.

The oil industry was the fastest-growing customer of middle distillates like diesel during the first shale boom from 2009 to 2014, and then again for 2017 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).\"It's like the snake biting its own tail,\" said Alexandre Ramos-Peon, senior analyst at Rystad Energy. \"The collapse of new drilling and completion could account for a demand loss of up to 1 percent of total US diesel demand.\"Oil companies account for a small percentage of US distillate demand - just 2.4 percent as of 2018, according to the latest EIA data. Trucking represents a vast majority of US diesel demand, but there is overlap, as trucks are used in the oilfields to transport crude from wellheads to pipelines when there aren't gathering lines.US energy firms are expected to have cut oil and gas rig counts to their lowest levels in history, dating back 80 years, as of this week.

Some, no doubt, have made real progress.But it\u2019s time to admit that, for the vast majority of students, online learning and worksheets are no substitute for trained teachers in classrooms.For most children, the school year effectively ended in March.If the country doesn\u2019t recognize this fact and respond accordingly \u2014 with large federally funded programs to reverse the losses \u2014 we will do great harm to a generation of children who will learn less than those who went before them. They will read and write more poorly and be less likely to graduate from high school and college. The resulting shortage of highly trained workers will hamper the economic recovery and intensify earnings inequality.Educators, parents, students and schools are doing what they can in a harrowing situation. But for most students it isn\u2019t nearly enough, and the United States will need to marshal enormous resources to get education back on track.About a third of the school year has been sacrificed to the pandemic. Consider that a year of U.S. public education costs about $400 billion. That implies that about $133 billion may be needed to make up for lost instructional time.That\u2019s a lot of money, roughly equivalent to the cost, in today\u2019s dollars, of the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after the devastation of World War II. But the disruption to American society created by this pandemic has no parallel in modern history.It has exposed and intensified enormous gaps in schools\u2019 and families\u2019 capacity to support children\u2019s learning. Many families, especially in rural areas, lack access to broadband internet service. Parents and multiple siblings may share a single computer, if they have one at all. A quiet place to study may not exist in a small, crowded apartment.Parents who must leave home to work have limited time to supervise children\u2019s schooling. The same is true for parents who must work from home, who have infants or who are caring for the sick. As Cleveland\u2019s schools prepared to close in late March, teachers set out to speak with every student\u2019s family about remote learning. They were initially able to reach 60% of parents. After trying for a few more days, they were still unable to connect with the family of 1 out of 10 students.Most children will return to school without the skills and concepts they were meant to master this spring. Many will have lost ground, and will need to relearn an entire year\u2019s worth of material.This is what the United States will confront as schools reopen. Fourth grade can\u2019t start in September with the usual curriculum if students missed half of third grade. They will need to compensate with more time spent on learning.One option is summer school, in places where it is safe to reopen by summer. Another is extended school days and weeks, with the extra hours devoted to bringing children up to speed.Students may well need to engage in social distancing for a long while. To keep down crowding, students could rotate days spent in teacher-led classrooms. On days children are not in classrooms, they could work with tutors in small groups (online, if that\u2019s what health officials recommend).The federal government can tap unused energy and talent by funding a big domestic volunteer effort for our schools, in the style of AmeriCorps. There will be far too many unemployed college students \u2014 and graduates \u2014 in the coming years, because recessions always hit young workers the hardest.Young people could be paid a stipend to tutor, troubleshoot technology for online classes, assist teachers (virtually or in person) and disinfect classrooms. High school students who typically work during the summer and after school could be paid to attend classes themselves.Even after schools restart, there are likely to be rolling closures while the pandemic unfolds. Online instruction will still be needed and should be as effective as possible. Some schools and teachers have made the online transition successfully, but most need technical and pedagogical support.States can\u2019t possibly foot the bill for an effort on this scale. State tax revenue is plunging, and the states are generally barred from running deficits. Nor is this a project for a nonprofit, a foundation or a private outfit like Kickstarter. The federal government needs to step in.The return on this investment would be substantial. First, paying for all this would stimulate the economy because teachers and young people would quickly spend what they earned. And then, the economic payoff would keep coming for decades in the form of a better-educated, more productive society.The setbacks in education aren\u2019t universal: There are exceptions, of course. Some lucky parents have had the time and resources to closely supervise their children\u2019s schooling. Some gifted children are adept at independent learning and have kept up with their studies. But this is not the norm, and it should not be expected.Society is now built around the assumption that school-age children go to school. Few families have a stay-at-home adult who can step into the shoes of a professional teacher. A recent paper by two economists at the University of Chicago estimates that just 37% of American jobs can be regularly done from home.I home-schooled my kids for a few years, and it wasn\u2019t easy. A lot of luck made it possible: a flexible work schedule, a well-paying job, a supportive spouse, a comfortable home, healthy children, and my own good health and education. Few families have the resources to pull off home schooling. Yet it is now being expected of all parents \u2014 including those who hold multiple jobs, are raising children alone, earn the minimum wage and may not have finished high school.Unless the United States takes action to restore the education that so many children have lost, it will suffer as a society. There is likely to be rising inequality in our schools, with widening gaps in achievement and spiking dropout rates. This surging inequality will then spill into the workforce, with the well educated commanding higher salaries because of their scarcity and the poorly educated earning even less because their numbers have grown.The future I fear is one in which a privileged minority of children are well educated, using private resources like tutors, private schools and home schooling, while the vast majority that depend on the public schools are left even further behind.For most children, the school year ended in March.

Initially, its gross borrowing target was Rs 7.8 lakh crore. That has now been increased to Rs 12 lakh crore.Here are the answers to some of the key questions you may have about the government\u2019s borrowing programme and how it affects various stakeholders.Governments like companies always spend more than they earn via taxes. The assumption is that, if government invests in education, health and infrastructure, it will improve productivity and boost economic growth. This should more than pay for the debt the government has incurred.Depends on how high. If the annual interest rate the government is paying on old debt is higher than the rate of growth in revenue, that\u2019s bad. You are then borrowing more to pay old debt.High debt is not bad provided it is accompanied by high growth. Thus far, India\u2019s combined state and central fiscal deficit has been higher than that of other countries\u2019 rated BBB-. But our deficit is tolerated, since no other country in this BBB-category can boast of a 10 percent plus nominal GDP growth. In the 2000s, nominal GDP growth was 14-16 percent.All corporates bonds, all interest rates are priced higher than the interest rate paid by the government. The sovereign pays the least rate of interest because she can\u2019t default, she can print and pay. Now, if sovereign borrowing is too high, buyers of government bonds will want a higher rate of interest. If the yieldS on government bonds go up, cost of debt or cost of capital goes up for everyone. So higher sovereign borrowing is not welcome unless it is spent so wisely (like bank recapitalisation or highway construction) that productivity and tax collections go up.Economists say the shortfall in tax revenues this year for the government will be almost 1 percent of the GDP, due to weak economic activity. Assuming the GDP is flat at Rs 200 lakh crore (Rs 200 trillion), the tax shortfall is Rs 2 lakh crore. The. The government budgeted a divestment income of Rs 2 lakh crore, which looks tough in this risk averse milieu. So the Rs 4.2 lakh crore excess borrowing is expected to just about meet revenue shortfall.It depends on the support that RBI extends to the government\u2019s borrowing programme. If RBI buys some of the bonds issued by the government, the economy will be benefitted as interest rates will not rise. But if the economy does not grow, the excess money sloshing around in the system can cause inflation.Likewise. If the RBI supports the government borrowing, corporates will be less hurt by a rise in cost of borrowing. Also, companies will hopefully get their dues from the government. Right now the government is postponing legitimate payments due to private sector.Don\u2019t expect a steep fall in home loan and other rates, provided you have the courage to take a home loan. But if you have secure government job, it is a good time to take a home loan. Pensioners could hurt if inflation rises going forward.With RBI support, yields on government bonds will stay at 6 percent for 10-year bonds. Without RBI support, yields can rise to 6.5 percent or even 7 percent"], "tags": "#Business#Economy#Government of India#India"},

It is also recommended to keep the room ventilated (doors or windows left open) whenever the AC is not in use.\u201dIn its guidelines for room ACs, RAMA said the temperature should be kept between 24 to 30 degree Celsius. Here, 24 is for humid climate and 30 for dry weather.\u00a0The units are designed to maintain humidity between 40 and 60. In dry climate, where humidity is less, it recommended increasing humidity by keeping water in a shallow pan.\u201cVentilate the room adequately by keeping the window slightly open while running the AC with the exhaust fan running in the adjacent bathroom if possible and by keeping doors and windows open when the AC is not operated,\u201d it added.The association said the frequency of filter cleaning should be increased for room ACs. This cleaning can be done at home with the help of video tutorials available online.With respect to central AC systems used in offices and other commercial applications, contrary to the general perception that it is a closed-air system, RAMA said these systems are in fact well-ventilated.A standard central air conditioning system design includes a mechanical ventilation-cum-filtration system that draws in adequate fresh air. A central air conditioning system also maintains relative humidity between 40-70 percent, which is ideal for avoiding the propagation of COVID-19 virus. Hence, central ACs are safe to use,\u201d RAMA said in the statement.For commercial ACs, RAMA said protocols given in the should be followed while\u00a0starting\u00a0a system after a prolonged shutdown.It added that the temperature setting can be between between 24\u00a0and 30 degree Celsius.

Growth is expected to rebound to 6.6 per cent in 2021-22 fiscal.For calendar year 2020, Moody's had last month projected a 0.2 per cent growth.The rapid and widening spread of the COVID-19, deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices, and financial market turmoil are creating a severe and extensive economic and financial shock, Moody's said.Lower growth and government revenue generation, coupled with coronavirus-related fiscal stimulus measures, will lead to higher government debt ratios which we project to rise to around 81 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years,\" it noted.At present, India's debt is about 72 per cent of the estimated GDP of 2019.It said the economic shock from the pandemic and the fiscal policy response will result in significant slippage from the 3.5 per cent fiscal deficit target in current fiscal.\"Further increases in fiscal expenditure to support the economy, combined with weaker overall revenue and disinvestment receipts, are likely to drive the central government deficit to around 5.5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2020 (2020-21),\" Moody's said.The international rating agency said consistent slippage from central government deficit targets, a widening of state-level deficits, and challenges in implementing the goods and services tax indicates that fiscal policymaking has been \"less effective\".Also, slow progress in resolving banking sector asset quality issues and addressing non-bank financial sector risks, as well as lack of progress on land and labour reforms at the national level, highlight still material government and policy effectiveness issues, it added.The outlook for India's debt burden is significantly dependent on trends in nominal GDP growth, it stated.On March 26, the government had announced a stimulus package worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore comprising of free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash dole to poor women and elderly.A second package, aimed at industries, is said to be in works and is likely to be announced shortly.Overall, the fiscal stimulus is modest compared with support packages implemented in many other countries, particularly given the breadth of India's nationwide lockdown measures.We expect the government will announce additional measures in the future... While the measures will help reduce some of the economic damage to households, the lockdown and ongoing stress in the financial system will cause a sharp decline in India's overall growth, exacerbating fiscal pressures, it said.Several international agencies including International Monetary Fund and World Bank have cut India's growth forecast over concerns about the fallout of COVID-19 pandemic.The IMF has slashed India's GDP growth projection to 1.9 per cent in 2020 from 5.8 per cent estimated in January.Similarly World Bank has estimated India's economy to grow between 1.5 to 2.8 per cent in the 2020-21.Fitch has projected India's GDP to grow at 0.8 per cent this fiscal, while S&P pegs GDP growth for India at 1.8 per cent in the current fiscal."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#India"},

Medical bills are going through the roof for\u00a0patients while\u00a0hospitals blame it\u00a0on additional costs incurred to check\u00a0infection. Amidst all this, the insurance premiums for group health covers may also go to 10-15 percent in the next six to seven months with rising claims.\u201cThere are group insurance policyholders incurring higher charges for COVID-19 treatment. But even for regular procedures, individuals are choosing high-end hospitals increasing the claim amount. This is adding to total costs,\u201d said the head of underwriting at a mid-size private insurer.Group health covers are taken by corporates for their employees. The premium is dependent on the number of employees, profession and location of the facility. It can range between Rs 1,500 to 5,000. The policies are renewed on an annual basis.Moneycontrol had  that from January 2020 there would be a premium increase in group health covers by 15 percent.From March 2020 onwards, the number of COVID-19 cases in India has been on the rise touching 56,342 reported positive cases on May 7. With every hospitalisation, the costs in the hospital go up with the need for\u00a0additional personal protective equipment, gloves, face shields and masks.These costs are spilling over to the non-COVID-19 patients as well. So even individuals admitted for a regular surgery are being charged COVID-19 charges. This is because regular outpatient departments in hospitals are shut, elective surgery postponed and hospitals say this is the only way to recover costs.This has directly impacted the insurance companies who are partly bearing the higher costs incurred by insured patients in the hospital.\u201cCOVID-19 spread across the world has led to a hike in health claims globally. Reinsurers who are bearing the brunt of higher claims by insurers are planning to hike rates. This will be passed on to customers,\u201d said the chief executive of a health insurer.In India, about 1,200 claims are reported to be received so far for health insurance related to COVID-19 amounting to approximately Rs 25 crore.Considering the risks involved in the business, almost all general policies are reinsured by insurance companies. In other words, they buy a cover for themselves in case the insurers themselves are hit with a large claim.Insurance works on a concept of pooling. The premiums paid goes into a pool and the claim gets paid out of this common pool. The idea here is that the pool should have a mix of young, old, sick and healthy to ensure that there aren\u2019t too many claims. Higher the number of people in the pool more is the ability of an insurer to pay the claims.Group health insurance is a product that is among the most popular among Indian corporates. This is used as an attraction tool to hire candidates and often covers the employee and his/her spouse, children and parents. There has been a 20-25 percent rise every year in the number of corporates opting for medical cover for the staff.However, the COVID-19 situation has sent insurance companies into a tizzy. There have been reports of employees opting for expensive hospitals and consultations for regular ailments.\u201cThe symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, shortness of breath, dry cough and runny nose. Individuals who would otherwise not visit a hospital for any of these symptoms are now choosing to do in fear of the virus outbreak. This has also pushed costs up,\u201d said the head of claims at a state-owned general insurer.Insurance executives also said the co-pay element will see a further increase. Co-pay means the policyholder would have to bear a cost of the claim; which could between 10-50 percent.Further, coverage for additional persons including spouse, child or parents could be chargeable.

In fact, the COVID-19 expenses can go upwards of Rs. 5 lakh. "], "time": ["Last Updated : May 08, 2020 12:43 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["Moneycontrol.com"], "article": ["I have always believed that health insurance is a must-have policy to live a life of dignity and to have access to the best medical facilities. It has suddenly gained limelight after the  outbreak. There is an increase in the number of inquiries on whether existing health insurance policy covers hospitalization expenses related to COVID-19, and many people are also approaching insurers to buy a policy for themselves and their family members.This makes me wonder: why is it that an eye-opening event is required for people to become aware of this important social security tool? Though we see an increase in the number of inquiries, it is still a surprise we don\u2019t see as much uptake as it should be considering that health insurance in India is under-penetrated. It is mainly because our brains are not wired for risk, we feel nothing will happen to us and thus insurance doesn\u2019t occupy a space in our wallet share so as to speak.It is not uncommon in India, that you see people struggling to pay for their hospitalization expenses. At the billing counter of the hospital, there is always someone who has either exhausted savings or sold their valuable assets to pay for the hospitalization expenses. Healthcare treatment costs are growing exponentially by at least 15 percent year on year. In fact, the COVID-19 expenses can go upwards of Rs 5 lakh.It is not just about the COVID-19 virus outbreak, irrespective of that, medical exigencies are always unpredictable. Hence, it is crucial to have health insurance to be prepared for it.Health insurance is considered as a dead investment by many because it doesn\u2019t give any return or it is just a tax saving tool. Its true value is only evident when things go wrong and that\u2019s the exact purpose of insurance. It helps you lead a life of dignity without digging into your savings, borrowing from someone or selling your valuable assets.Think of it in a way that you may pay a premium for five to seven years without a single hospitalisation, but one such hospitalisation can be worth a lot more than the premium paid over such a time period, making it a worthwhile investment towards an uncertainty.I firmly believe that one must have comprehensive health insurance cover which is a combination of a basic health insurance policy, super top up which comes handy if base policy sum insured gets exhausted and critical illness policy that provides you lump sum benefit amount as per the sum insured if diagnosed with the listed ailment under the policy. This mix will help you be prepared for most of the medical exigencies and stay worry-free in terms of managing medical expenses without being dependent on anyone.Health insurance also allows you to access quality medical treatment as you don\u2019t hesitate to visit a doctor with a financial back-up in hand. If you see today, there are people who frequently visit hospital for fever, flu among others. This is because they know that their medical expenses will be taken care of with health insurance, rather than staying at home, experimenting with remedies to treat themselves and wait for things to get aggravated.It is also vital to have a health insurance policy with appropriate sum insured. Under-insurance will defeat the purpose of having insurance as towards the end, you end up paying some amount from your own pocket if you are not rightly covered.Hence, it is advisable to assess your medical requirement, understand various health insurance policy by checking their coverage and exclusions, services provided by the insurer before choosing a policy. See if your requirement is fulfilled with a health insurance policy and accordingly opt for one, rather than blindly buying one which offers the lowest premium.I would suggest good research on not just the products, but the claims track record and servicing capability of the insurance company being considered. Always speak to an expert or an insurance advisor as insurance is very much a product which is bought over conversations. Health insurance is quite affordable. If you consider the amount of treatment costs against which it covers you, it is quite miniscule. But always remember, price should not be the deciding factor, it should be the fulfillment of your requirements and track record of the insurer.I always suggest starting early on in life with a health insurance policy, but it is never too late to buy a health insurance policy, if you don\u2019t have one, buy it now to safeguard yourselves and your loved ones against unpredictable medical exigencies. It is times like these that remind us of the importance of a robust health insurance policy, but let the reminder turn into an inquiry and let that inquiry result in the purchase of a good health insurance coverage."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#insurance"},

The recent excise duty hikes could give the government headroom to facilitate such measures.The government had begun to benefit from low oil prices via an about Rs 15 per litre hike in excise duties on petrol and diesel (yielding nearly Rs 2 lakh crore in additional revenues for FY21) and savings on petroleum subsidies (budgeted at Rs 35,000 crore for FY21), a BOBCAPS report said.\u201cThe Centre could target cumulative gains of about Rs 4 lakh crore in order to neutralise potentially lower GST collections and divestment revenues, implying a further excise hike of Rs 10 per litre in FY21,\" the report said.However, the government has a huge fiscal gap to plug so the hope of a big-bang move appears irrational.The market is not expecting a bazooka from the government as it has limited fiscal space, say experts.The stimulus will be more of limited and specific relief that will mostly be filtered via banks.While a delay is getting investors worried, the most important thing to watch out for will be its area of focus.Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing, said the stimulus would not address the urgent need for a cash-flow boost required by corporates and individuals.\"The market is mostly peaked out in terms of expectations, now real numbers getting disclosed by corporate results and the macro data will start the second leg of broad-based selling,\" he said.G Chokkalingam, Founder & MD, Equinomics Research Advisory, said the market should not expect too much.\"The market cannot expect the stimulus similar to the US and Europe.

Other assistance packages have been put together by governments around the world, but the emphasis has mostly been on the immediate need to get money into people's pockets, not on large-scale public investments.IMF economists noted that such investment types of spending during previous downturns came too late and were not well targeted, adding they could have the effect of spurring private consumption and investment through higher inflation expectations and lower real interest rates.\"To reduce implementation lags and guide expectations, policymakers should act swiftly to establish a pipeline of appraised investment projects now that can be implemented when the health crisis abates, and plan discretionary measures that can be deployed quickly,\" the IMF said."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#IMF#World News"},

If you are a movie buff and are dreaming about love at first sight at the campus, holding hands with your partner or eating lunch with your crush, your plans could get shattered. While amidst the coronavirus outbreak, the academic sessions for 2020 may begin by July 2020. But college life won\u2019t be the same.Social distancing would have become a new norm, so hanging out with friends in the campus could be restricted to some extent. Masks and gloves (in some research-led roles) would become the new normal.Institutes across India told Moneycontrol that no student will be allowed to take off their masks during their time in the campus nor will shaking hands and hugging be allowed.A lockdown to minimise COVID-19 spread has led to a delay in the academic schedules across campuses. This includes examinations, admissions as well as research submissions. The disruptions are expected to continue for the next three to six months.Be it the large institutes such as the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) or other colleges, how academics and campuses function could see a change.\u201cA few IITs may have to cancel semester examinations to minimise the virus spread. When it comes to Ph.D. candidates, the viva or oral assessments could be held using video conferencing tools,\u201d said a senior IIT professor.Mahadeo Jaiswal, professor and director of IIM Sambalpur told Moneycontrol that the institute is among the first IIMs of the country to have conducted the remaining of their MBA 2020 admission process online which included the written exam and personal interview.\u201cWhile the written examination was conducted through a third-party online proctoring system where students could login and write their answers in 300 words limit within 20-minute slot, the Personal Interview are being conducted directly by IIM Sambalpur through Zoom video conferencing VC,\u201d he added.IIM Sambalpur had more than 400 students who appeared for the written exams online while sitting at their homes. The answer scripts are currently being evaluated by the faculty members of IIM Sambalpur.Here, the third-party online proctoring portal served only as platform for the students to appear and give the examination. Jaiswal said that the online proctoring system allowed each student to be monitored and invigilated through an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tool so that they did not receive any external help for writing their answers.The interface also captured the retina movement of the prospective candidates. The exam disrupts even if an examinee attends a phone call. The recording of the student\u2019s writing their exam along with the answer script were then sent to IIM Sambalpur for scrutiny.Keeping internet disruption in mind, this institute allowed students a 30 minute buffer time for the exam as well. In case a student was unable to attend the exam due to internet connectivity issues for long hours, they would have been allowed to appear for the exam in an alternative slot. However, the questions in each slot would have been completely different as it is randomly allotted.Riding on the heels of the success of this process, Jaiswal said that IIM Sambalpur decided to conduct the end term examinations of first year students online as well. The batch of 2019-2021 had to leave campus and return home before their examination started due to the lockdown.\"We will now have 100 students appearing for the end term exam of 10-12 subjects through the same online proctoring system while sitting at home from different parts of the country,\" he added.\u00a0This will be the first-of-its-kind initiative taken by any IIM across the country.Similarly, IIT Gandhinagar told Moneycontrol in an emailed response that while it has no plans to cancel semester evaluations, the norms for social distancing are being discussed and a final decision would be taken.At IIM Ahmedabad, the spokesperson said that the mid-term examinations for the postgraduate programme in management will be postponed since the institute will only commence the academic year in July 2020.Across college campuses, there could be a delay of anywhere between one to three months for the new academic year to begin. There could also be dropouts if exam results are delayed.\u201cAll institutes are offering only provisional admissions. If there is a delay in getting the mark sheet or if the candidate has failed in the previous examination,\u00a0their admission would be revoked. So there could be cases where students may find their friends missing from college after a few months because of this reason,\u201d said the head of admissions at a Mumbai-based technology institute.Though some flexibility would be provided in submission of mark sheets, delays post September 2020 would not be acceptable in most colleges across India.For smaller institutes that do not require competitive examinations, COVID-19 would also led to shrinking of the class strength. The director of a West Bengal-based commerce college said that social distancing within the classroom would mean that the number of students admitted in 2020 would reduce by 20-25 percent.\"Our campus is small and each class has about 100 people. We cannot hold multiple lecture sessions in a day for the same subject/module so the idea is to cut down the class size,\" he added.IIT Madras spokesperson told Moneycontrol that the decision on semester examinations is unclear right now and it will depend on when public transport is opened up across India.\u201cOur plan is to open up in stages, starting with the final-year students and research scholars who are about to submit their theses,\u201d they added.Further, the institute spokesperson said that if the final-year students are able to successfully return and complete their requirements, it will give IIT Madras the learning and confidence to ask the students and scholars from other years to return in batches.Across 993 Universities, 39,931 colleges and 10,725 standalone institutes in India, a similar rule is expected to be followed.A phase-wise opening up of college campuses would mean that educational institutes would be able to gauge student response and also minimise risks from the virus. For instance, if only one batch comes in and a student tests positive, other batches would not be impacted by it.While the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry has advised educational institutions to not neglect social distancing even if the COVID-19 spread is minimised, each institute can decide on what guidelines would follow.Moneycontrol spoke to eight different institutes, in the areas of humanities, engineering, management, commerce and design, to understand what would be the proposed changes.At IIT Madras, the spokesperson said that since the institute is planning to open first with only the about-to-graduate students, the students completing projects will be dispersed across the hundreds of labs in the departments and will be able to maintain adequate social distancing. Everyone will be wearing cloth masks.\u201cThe first and foremost is to operate the hostels and messes at a small fraction of full capacity so that no one shares rooms, only a fraction of the rooms are occupied, mess tables are sparsely occupied at any time. The number of students taking exams at any given time will be small and we will seat them few and far apart. We are also equipping restrooms with hands-free taps and soap dispensers,\u201d said the institute.At IIM Sambalpur, Jaiswal said that the temperature of every student, faculty and other members will be screened regularly. However, he said that social distancing in classrooms may not be possible as the institute cannot reduce the number of students attending a class. But, the institute will limit frequent visitors to the campus and restrict going in and out of the campus.Another Delhi-based college known for its arts curriculum is planning a staggered lunch break depending on the student profile.\u201cThe idea is to not crowd the cafeteria. Hence, lunch breaks would be spread across in such a way that students sit apart. No hand-holding or sitting next to each other may be permitted for the next six to eight months. Sharing plates and food would also be discouraged. But this would also mean lunch breaks get shorter,\u201d said the chief administrative officer at the college quoted above.This institute is planning to seek help from the Delhi government to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for the canteen staff as well as the gymnasium and sports room administrators.Across the institutes, it is likely that the lecture timings could get longer to make up for the lost time. A regular review would be done every month to evaluate if the processes are working smoothly.Amidst this, if any student tests positive, the colleges have also decided that they would shift to e-classes for the next two to three weeks till the campus is completely sanitised and close contacts are quarantined.Cultural activities and fests where students have an opportunity to meet fellows from other colleges are likely to be suspended for the next six months in anticipation of crowding in campuses.For now, COVID-19 would have made college campuses turn into 'all work and no play' zones."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#HR"},

It has also hit jobs.The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7 percent in 2019 to 9 percent in 2020 but then fall to around 8 percent in 2021, the commission said.While the virus hit every member country, the extent of the damage it ultimately inflicts will depend on the evolution of the disease in each of them, the resilience of their economies and what policies they put in place to respond.Gentiloni said that the depth of the recession and the strength of recovery will be uneven across the world's biggest trading bloc.Much will depend, he said, on \u201cthe speed at which lockdowns can be lifted, the importance of services like tourism in each economy and by each country's financial resources.Such divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area - yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action.\u201dHow quickly things can change.On February 13, the commission had predicted \u201ca path of steady, moderate growth\u201d this year and next of 1.2 percent.At that time, uncertainty over US trade policy and a Brexit trade deal plus tensions in Latin America and the Middle East were the main threats.The coronavirus outbreak in China was noted at the time as \u201ca new downside risk\u201d but the commission's assumption less than three months ago was \u201cthat the outbreak peaks in the first quarter, with relatively limited global spillovers.\u201d"], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#European Union#World News"},

Their importance in sustaining supply chains can be gauged by the fact that ports handle over 95 percent of India\u2019s international trade by volume and 70 percent by value.With India\u2019s export-import destinations being impacted by COVID-19, cargo movement has nearly stopped. The reduction in economic activity has led to a decrease in demand for crude oil and container traffic across the world. This may mean that the already low capacity utilisation \u2014 which stands at about 47 percent \u2014 of major Indian ports may fall further.These are also witnessing a huge accumulation of cargo and empty containers as shipping lines cut down sailings to avoid losses. The Directorate General of Shipping issued guidelines to all Indian ports to screen incoming vessels and quarantine suspected ones. This, however, added to delays in evacuation already caused due to port congestion and resulted in an increase in turnaround time by almost six times.After the pandemic, it is expected that economies would not like to put all their eggs in one basket and would reduce import dependencies on China. This could be an opportunity for India to launch farsighted, multi-pronged reforms to overhaul its ports to attract more cargo traffic. The Major Port Authorities Bill, 2020, requires to be expeditiously passed to provide the much-needed autonomy to major ports.An effective implementation of the Sagarmala programme, aimed at creating coastal economic zones and enhancing hinterland connectivity, can prove to be a game-changer in linking ports with India\u2019s export-import industry. Planned development of hub ports with deeper drafts at ideal locations can prove beneficial for invigorating coastal economic activity and providing employment opportunities.The ongoing pandemic would see government expenditure switching towards social sectors in the short run. However, port efficiency enhancement can be a vital cost-effective measure to revamp the ports. Currently, the average turnaround time at Indian ports is over 59 hours \u2014 the global average is 24 hours. India can utilise the opportunity hidden behind this crisis to its advantage only if it has the capabilities to handle freight efficiently.Under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign, physical documentation has already been done away with at ports. However, there still exist implementation problems, which must be resolved, to reduce detention and demurrage. This calls for standardisation of procedures across ports, 24X7 operation of principal governance agencies providing clearances, and complete digitisation of container freight stations.The Port Community System, used for coordination among port operators, suffers from frequent breakdown errors. The efforts of the Ministry of Shipping to move to a National Maritime Portal for all EXIM stakeholders need to be paced up.Technological advancements, such as exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous or robotic operations at terminals or container freight stations, can be a key catalyst. This will not only improve efficiency in processes, but also build resilience to shocks, such as this pandemic. There is a long road ahead, but India has the potential to traverse it by undertaking a planned implementation of these structural reforms. It has been rightly said, \u2018There can be no economy where there is no efficiency.\u2019"], "tags": "#China#COVID19#Crude oil#Economy#IMF#lockdown#Make in India#ports#shipping sector#trade"},

As Moody's already assigned it a junk rating, $35 billion of the carmaker's debt became ineligible for investment grade indexes, which are tracked by passive funds.The Fed also said it would buy exchange-traded funds that hold high-yield debt, while the European Central Bank may also eventually adopt outright purchases of high-yield bonds. In March it included BB-/B1 rated Greek bonds in emergency asset-buying schemes and started accepting fallen angel debt as collateral last month.The interventions unclogged frozen junk markets, with U.S. companies issuing more than $30 billion of new high-yield debt in April in one of the 10 busiest months on record. But longer-term ramifications are potentially bigger for a global investment industry where much capital allocation is still shaped by credit ratings.Although some investment-grade fund managers have ventured into junk bonds since the 2008-9 financial crisis, the latest move may well turbo-charge the departure from ratings-defined investment processes, especially the cliff-edge division between high-yield and high-grade debt.\"What active managers have been doing since the financial crisis is increasing the flexibility of their mandates,\" said James Vokins, head of investment-grade UK credit at Aviva Investors.\"(Central bank moves) should accelerate the momentum among active managers to go to clients and trustees for some kind of waiver on high-yield holdings so they are not forced to sell at the worst possible time.\"Reflecting the interest in investing across the ratings spectrum, fund rating firm Morningstar says it now tracks 206 European credit funds that can hold investment-grade (IG) as well as high-yield (HY), versus 180 five years ago.Vokins said several of Aviva's IG-only funds had the ability to hold some BB-rated credits.\"These are restrictions we asked to be slightly softened, to allow us hold the bonds a bit longer,\" he said.Legal & General Investment Management was among those going into the latest crisis with a number of funds able to hold 5%-20% in high-yield debt.\"We have seen an increasing desire for funds over the year to increase their flexibility to invest off-benchmark,\" said portfolio manager Justin Onuekwusi.Nonetheless, ratings assessments still carry huge clout.Indexes reserved for top-grade bonds and the passive funds that track them have little leeway and investors such as insurers face strict regulatory constraints on holding lower-rated securities.Agencies say they merely score borrowers' creditworthiness based on objective criteria, with boundaries between the BBB and BB baskets usually reinforced by markets. Fitch for example notes how investors rushed to sell BBB- debt during the current crisis as market stress built, even before a downgrade.They also say their ratings aim to guide investors on default probabilities\u00a0 -- for instance, the five-year default probability for credits on the lowest investment grade rung, BBB- is 2.8%, but 3.7% for BB+, the top junk category, according to S&P Global.Among other hurdles, flexible strategy funds usually need to hire high-yield specialists for the additional legal and covenant analysis junk bond investing requires, Morningstar analyst Mara Dobrescu said.And \"while central bank actions have improved liquidity in high-yield, over the long-term it's unlikely they will become as liquid as investment grade,\" Dobrescu added.That means investors, especially in closely regulated sectors, are unlikely to discount credit scores altogether.Yet central bank support could be a powerful impetus for more flexibility, especially as yields, or returns, on high-grade debt tumble further and junk markets swell -- S&P Global predicts around $640 billion of European and U.S. bonds will turn fallen angel this year.\"You are going to get some people that are forced to sell these bonds. But when you have another buyer and a buyer of last resort, it does make it easier (to hold fallen angels),\" said Iain Stealey, international CIO, fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.\"You are going to see more of a broad remit that will start looking at high-yield. Once we can see light at the end of the tunnel it will happen.\""], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#European Central Bank#US Federal Reserve#World News"},

Watch out, world"], "sub_heading": ["New forecasts predict a 7.4 percent economic collapse and risks of even worse decline if the reopening triggers a second virus wave."], "time": ["Last Updated : May 07, 2020 05:56 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["New York Times"], "article": ["The good news for Europe is that the worst of the pandemic is beginning to ease. This week deaths in Italy hit a nearly two-month low. And the German leader Angela Merkel announced that schools, day care centres and restaurants would reopen in the next few days.But the relief could be short-lived.The European Commission released projections on May 6 that Europe\u2019s economy will shrink by 7.4 percent this year. A top official told residents of the European Union, first formed in the aftermath of World War II, to expect the \u201cdeepest economic recession in its history.\u201dTo put this figure in perspective, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s economy had been predicted to grow by 1.2 percent this year. In 2009, at the back of the global financial crisis, it shrank by 4.5 percent.It\u2019s a grim reminder that even if the virus dissipates, the economic fallout could pressure the world economy for months, if not years.In China, where the outbreak has subsided in recent weeks, the factories that power the global supply chain have been fired up. But with few global buyers for its goods, its economy has been slow to recover.In the United States, where the growth of new cases in the hardest-hit areas shows signs of slowing and there is a push to lift lockdowns, there are also signs that a recovery may be elusive. The government on May 8 is set to release the monthly employment report, and some forecasts predict a loss of more than 20 million jobs in April \u2014 a number that would wipe out a decade\u2019s worth of job gains.The European Union, home to 440 million people, is the United States\u2019 No 1 trading partner, and China\u2019s second-largest. It\u2019s the biggest foreign investor in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world.A prolonged European recession, a second wave of the virus or an anaemic economic recovery would spell added misery for many Europeans, and hurt companies, banks and people the world over. The crisis is also reigniting political divisions between a wealthier north and a poorer south, threatening to break the brittle balance between divergent nations with inextricably linked economies.A recovery will probably start unevenly in the second half of the year, Paolo Gentiloni, European commissioner for economy, said at a news conference after the release of the forecast, which comes out four times a year. But by the end of 2021 the countries of the European Union will be in worse shape than they were just two months ago, before the coronavirus started ripping through the continent. US gross domestic product fell at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, and some economists believe it will contract at an annual rate of 30 percent or more in the current quarter.\u201cThe danger of a deeper and more protracted recession is very real,\u201d the head of the commission\u2019s economic unit, Maarten Verwey, said in the forecast\u2019s foreword. A resurgence of the virus after the end of lockdowns would shave a further three percentage points off economic performance this year, he said.The economies of Italy and Spain, two of the countries hardest hit by the disease, will most likely shrink by over 9 percent each this year, and Italy\u2019s economy will be particularly slow to recover, Gentiloni said.Greece, which had started turning a corner after a decade of economic calamity, will be worst-hit in the union, according to the forecasts, losing 9.7 percent of its economic output this year. Poland would suffer the least, with a 4.5 percent recession.And unemployment will most likely average 9 percent in the bloc, the European Commission said, from 6.7 percent the year before.The bloc\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, will also be hammered, suffering its worst recession since World War II, set to shrink by 6.5 percent, but it is expected to recover relatively quickly. France, the second-largest economy, is expected to contract 8.5 percent this year.The severe downturn in Europe will have major repercussions for US growth and jobs because the two economies are intimately connected.The European Union and the United States are each other\u2019s largest trading partners, exchanging goods and services worth $1.3 trillion last year. European companies like Daimler, BMW or Siemens employ more than 4 million people in the United States, according to US government figures.China will also suffer. The European Union is second only to the United States as a customer for Chinese goods.As grim as the economic outlook appears, the greater danger to the world economy may be the risk that the euro common currency could be undermined by the deepening rifts between its members and their leaders. That almost happened in the early years of the last decade, but was averted when the European Central Bank, the euro\u2019s Federal Reserve, used its monetary firepower to prevent Greece, Italy and Spain from becoming insolvent.The central bank is again flooding the eurozone with credit and buying the bonds of eurozone governments to keep their borrowing costs from spinning out of control. But the central bank\u2019s ability to rescue the euro again may be constrained after a ruling on May 5 by Germany\u2019s highest court.The German Constitutional Court issued an ultimatum to the European Central Bank, saying it must show that the side effects of the bond buying do not outweigh the economic benefits. The court threatened to bar Germany\u2019s central bank, the Bundesbank, from taking part in the stimulus programme, which would be a serious breach of European unity.The coronavirus is already producing an economic shock in Europe more severe than the one that followed the financial crisis in 2008. \u201cIt is clearly more massive, and it is going down more steeply,\u201d Clemens Fuest, President of the Ifo Institute, one of Germany\u2019s leading economic think tanks, said during an online presentation on May 6.The pandemic could have ramifications for politics and society that are impossible to predict. The economic dislocation caused by the 2008 financial crisis helped fuel far-right populist movements in Germany, Italy and France.Europe\u2019s best hope is that economies will bounce back quickly, in what economists optimistically call a V-shaped recession, as lockdowns are eased.Already, factories have resumed production in much of Italy, and Germany this week allowed hairdressers to begin receiving customers again. France will begin gradually ending its lockdown next week.But many restrictions remain, including bans on large public gatherings. And no one knows yet whether the virus will reappear with a vengeance as public life resumes.The fresh set of figures will pile pressure on European leaders to conjure up a brave joint response to the recession to ensure the recovery isn\u2019t lopsided, hurting the joint currency and spawning more political unrest in the weaker economies.Although the leaders have approved a half-trillion euros\u2019 worth of measures that effectively call on wealthier nations to subsidise the recovery of worse-hit poorer ones, they have been criticised for not going far enough.The persistent divide \u201cposes a threat to the single market and the euro area \u2014 yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action,\u201d Gentiloni said."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#world"},

The economy shrank in the first quarter at the steepest pace since the Great Recession of 2007-2009.The weekly claims report followed news on Wednesday that private payrolls fell by a record 20.2 million in April, which set up the overall labor market for historic job losses.It marked the fifth straight weekly decrease in applications since hitting a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.

But what was more shocking was that the final bill included \u2018COVID-19 charges\u2019 even though he was admitted for a kidney ailment.Upadhyay is one among many patients saddled with lakhs in\u00a0bills at hospitals that are unable to manage additional costs incurred due to COVID-19.\u201cWhen I checked with the hospital, I was told by the head doctor that the institution incurs almost Rs 9,000 per day, per patient, for COVID-19 related equipment like masks and personal protective equipment. It seems since the hospital has no other means to recover these costs, this is being added to the patient bill,\u201d said Upadhyay.His bill included Rs 6,000 per day as COVID-19 charges. While Upadhyay had an insurance policy, the insurer refused to pay the full COVID-19 charges incurred and capped it at Rs 1,000 daily.The COVID-19 pandemic has multiplied the anxiety of patients in private hospitals in India. While on the one hand, they risk contracting secondary infections like coronavirus, on the other, they are losing sleep\u00a0over hefty bills.Analysts estimate the COVID-19-related infection control measures such as testing in patients and staff, protective gears or PPE for health staff, social distancing protocols and human resources costs is resulting in bills getting inflated by 15-20 percent over and above the regular charges.Hospitals pointed out that\u00a0insurance companies do not cover the additional costs, forcing patients to pay out of pocket.Abhay Soi, Chairman of Max Healthcare and Radiant Life Sciences said, \u201cWe are sitting in a peculiar situation. Our finances are stretched and input costs are ramping up. This ramp-up has to be done when there is a huge disruption of the supply chain. The cost of personal protection equipment (PPE) that wasn't there earlier, is coming. Personnel cost has more than doubled.\u201dThe cost of personnel in these hospitals has gone up because, in COVID-19 hospitals, people work for 14 days and are then quarantined for 14 days. Soi said within this category some people are likely to get infected.\u201cWhen they are infected, we have to pay for their quarantine and also their salaries. Imagine what is happening to our cost structure. Our occupancies have dropped down to 35 percent. We have stopped doing elective surgeries. Our revenues plummeted, so have our cash flows and EBITDA,\u201d he added.Max Healthcare has dedicated 340 beds in Mumbai from around 900 beds and 320 beds in Delhi out of approximately 2,400 beds in its flagship hospitals for COVID treatment.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, complaints of overcharging in hospitals have surged\u00a0across India.On average, patients in metro cities are charged about Rs 1 lakh to 2.5 lakh per day depending on the ailment.This includes daily charges of Rs 4,500-9,000 for COVID-19 expenses such as on additional sanitisation including use of gloves, masks and personal protective equipment.The more serious and older the patient, the higher are the charges.Parag Khanna who recently got his 68-year-old father admitted to a Delhi hospital for asthma-related problems said the institution charged Rs 6,000 per day stating that PPE charges are high and that he is \u2018high-risk\u2019.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have an insurance cover and requested the hospital to waive it off because my father had no COVID-19 symptoms and had even tested negative. But we were told hospital is incurring high charges because his room is being disinfected multiple times and there is a higher use of masks and gloves,\u201d he added.With the absence of a healthcare regulator, there is no cap on the maximum amount that can be charged by hospitals for medical procedures. Nor is there any set guideline to be followed during a pandemic.Insurance and hospitals work through a pre-agreed set of terms and conditions every year. So, the previous terms continue even if there are new developments like a pandemic in this case.For example, if there is a heart surgery at a private hospital in Mumbai, a fixed rate of Rs 5-7 lakh could be set. For another private hospital in a smaller city like Indore, the fixed-rate could be lower. Here, once an insured patient is admitted with a heart ailment, the insurance company pays out the amount as per the agreed package.However, there are limits to room rents and what is covered under the hospitalisation expenses. Frills like television, food/beverage for attendants, nutritional supplements, antiseptic creams and external implants are typically not covered by the insurance policy.With costs spilling over in a bid to prevent infections, hospitals are now passing it on to the end-user.Hospitals had sought intervention from insurers seeking a higher package rate than those for regular ailments since infection-prevention costs like protective gear, ventilators and specialised treatment push up COVID-19 hospitalisation costs by at least 30 percent. But this is still under negotiation.Sol explained that for private hospitals 60-70 percent business comes from insured patients and added all of these need to be reworked because the actual cost of healthcare moved up.Insurance officials told Moneycontrol that some expenses will have to be borne by the patients/kin until package rates are revised.\u201cWe are also facing a similar high claims scenario. Rates cannot be suddenly changed when it was already pre-agreed upon. Hence, we are trying to see how best the costs can be shared. Going forward, insurers will increase the co-pay ailment as a buffer against infection control measures by hospitals,\u201d said the chief executive officer of a private general insurer.Co-pay means the policyholder shares a portion of the medical costs with the insurance company as part of the terms and conditions of a health insurance product. It is usually agreed in percentage terms and could be 10-40 percent of the claim.Till the time COVID-19 is not contained, the infection-control costs will stay high.For patients, the tough times may continue a little longer."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy"},

Egypt has begun repatriation flights from Kuwait, where security forces quelled a riot by Egyptians at a shelter housing residency violators this week.In the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar the numbers leaving \"could be very significant\", said Ryszard Cholewinski, ILO's senior migration specialist for Arab states.Farman, one of 60,000 Pakistanis registered to leave the UAE, lost his job as a school bus driver two months ago after education centres closed under virus containment measures.\"I want to go home because what's the point of staying without work?\" he said, standing in a dimly lit street in front of communal housing in Dubai's Al Quoz industrial area.And it is not only blue-collar workers who are caught up in the coronavirus squeeze. Many qualified professionals have not been spared.\"You go online, you apply for thousands of jobs, but they're all expired,\" said Egyptian-American architect Nada Karim, who was due to start a new job in Dubai when the firm froze hiring.\"I can resist here for two or three months without a salary, then I'll have to leave.\"Samer, a Lebanese-Canadian working at an advertising agency in Saudi Arabia, has been put on six-month unpaid leave and is considering moving to Canada if things do not improve.\"It is very confusing and worrying when you suddenly cannot plan for your future,\" he said.The Middle East is headed for an economic downturn this year that dwarfs 2008 and 2014/2015 as countries are hit by the double blow from coronavirus closures and record low oil prices, the International Monetary Fund said.\"Fewer expats will crimp demand for everything from pizzas to villas, and the danger is that this leads to a cascading deflationary impact with secondary job losses,\" said Tarek Fadlallah of Nomura Asset Management Middle East.Official unemployment data is not available, but several Gulf airlines and ride-sharing firm Careem have said they are laying off hundreds of workers. [nL8N2CI5S9][nL8N2CM58V]Dubai, a business and tourism hub, was hoping for an economic boost from hosting the Expo world fair this year but the event was postponed until Oct. 2021 due to the pandemic.Last week, Expo 2020 Dubai made redundant 179 employees, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. Expo declined to comment.\"Expatriates are not just a cog in the machine - they play an integral part in the domestic recycling of capital that helps sustain Gulf economies,\" said Robert Mogielnicki, a resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.The flight of expats could reduce government income from fees and value-added tax and slow reform efforts, including reducing state spending on wages and subsidies, analysts have said.In Kuwait, several parliamentarians warned they would block any draft law allowing private firms to cut wages of nationals, local newspapers reported on Wednesday.Gulf states will likely speed up programmes to \"nationalise\" jobs, with Oman last month ordering state firms to replace foreign employees with nationals. But this could make it even more difficult to jump-start economic growth, analysts said.Some Gulf diversification plans, such as Saudi Arabia's bid to build entertainment and non-religious tourism industries, hinge \"largely on the economic activities surrounding expatriate residents and foreign visitors\", said Mogielnicki.Presenter Oqaily, in a show aired on state-owned SBC TV, criticised Saudi businesses retaining expatriates as \"having no shame and knowing nothing about loyalty to the country.\"We have to stop making the Saudi employee a scapegoat with every crisis,\" he said. \"Get rid of the foreign labour that replaced the more skilled Saudis.\""], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#International Labour Organization#Kuwait#Oman#Saudi Arabia#UAE#World News"},

The tax hike could result in higher working capital outflow for the oil marketing companies, which will partly offset the working capital savings from lower inventory costs.\"According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, special additional excise duty on petrol has been hiked by Rs 2 per litre and road cess has been hiked by Rs 8 a litre. In case of diesel, special additional excise duty has been hiked by Rs 5 per litre and road cess has been raised by Rs 8 a litre.With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 32.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 31.83.Petrol costs Rs 71.26 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 69.39.Central excise duty makes up for 46 per cent of petrol and diesel price now. After considering local sales tax or VAT, the total tax incidence in the price is as high as 60 per cent.The excise tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.:\u00a0It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.It again raised excise duty on March 14 by Rs 3 per litre.In preparation for the excise duty hike, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had at the fag end of the Budget session of Parliament took the authorisation to raise excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 8 per litre each in future.Sitharaman through an amendment to the Finance Bill, 2020 raised the limit up to which the government can raise special excise duty on petrol and diesel to Rs 18 per litre and Rs 12 per litre, respectively.The March 14 excise duty hike included Rs 2 a litre increase in special additional excise duty and Re 1 in road and infrastructure cess.This hike took the special additional excise duty to maximum permissible limit in law \u2014 Rs 10 in case of petrol and Rs 4 in case of diesel.This, through an amendment to the Eighth Schedule of the Finance Act, was increased to Rs 18 per litre in case of petrol and Rs 12 in case of diesel.Government sources said the Centre has taken this step of increasing duty to raise some revenue in view of a tight fiscal situation.

It shows the number of jobless people is\u00a0skyrocketing after the lockdown started in late March. This, in turn, highlights the need for urgent fiscal support measures.What are the latest numbers? In the week-ended May 3, the unemployment rate shot up to 27.1 percent, . The agency explains the unemployment rate to surge\u00a0as the number of job seekers who couldn\u2019t find work rise. The labour participation rate rose from 35.4 percent in the week-ended April 21 to 36.2 percent in the week-ended May 3.\u00a0The fall in March employment rates was just 2 percent compared with 2019-20 average of 404 million. But in April, the fall was 30 percent. This, according to CMIE, translates to 122 million job losses in April.These numbers aren\u2019t really surprising. Companies aren\u2019t hiring on account of a standstill in their business situation. Instead, many firms are cutting even their existing workforce to reduce costs. Banks aren\u2019t keen to lend to small companies who are fund-starved. At the same time big companies are getting money, and a good part of these funds are used for refinance expensive loans, according to analysts.For small companies, a substantial fiscal stimulus package is the only hope.\u00a0 This is more critical to prevent further job losses. According to CMIE\u2019s Mahesh Vyas, the data for the first week of May indicates that unemployment rate could spike even further in May.India went on a nationwide lock-down from 24 March. The lockdown has now been extended till May 17. The near stagnation in economy has left small businesses and daily wage earners in a state of uncertainty. The government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package, which was followed up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with a few measures to ease liquidity constraints in the economy. But, these haven\u2019t benefited the unorganised sectors much.\u201cInitially, a lockdown only hurts the most vulnerable labour that is informally employed in unorganised sectors. Gradually, it starts hitting the more secure jobs. Startups have announced lay-offs and industry associations have warned of job losses,\u201d writes Vyas.But there\u2019s an interesting angle to the employment data. According to CMIE, the 'odd-man in the job bloodbath' is agriculture. According to CMIE study, the count of farmers increased in March and April. The count of farmers increased by\u00a0six million, or by 5 percent, in April compared to the average count of farmers in 2019-20.\u201cWhen jobs evaporate in other sectors, people revert back to their farms, which seem to have an infinite capacity to absorb labour, but unfortunately that employment is mostly disguised unemployment,\u201d Vyas wrote.Economists have drastically cut the GDP forecasts for the current fiscal factoring in the COVID-19 shock.

Most economists had already lowered their growth projections at the first sign of a prolonged closure. Even then, \u00a0is a shocker. The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index posted 5.4 in April compared with 49.3 in March. To put this number in perspective, this is the biggest contraction in services output since the data collection began 14 years ago, in 2005.Even before the services PMI data was released, the manufacturing PMI too had shown a significant decline\u2014to 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March.The services sector data though looks uglier. This is not only because of a steeper fall but also the fact that losses in the services sector cannot be recovered as quickly even after the economy opens up. The likely change in consumer behaviour after the lockdown could also add to services sector woes. With a fear that the disease spread may last for a while, consumers are unlikely to\u00a0step out to avail services as they used to prior to the lockdown.There are three quick takeaways from the April services PMI data:One, this fall justifies the sharp rise in unemployment figures in April-May. According to CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) data, the unemployment rate shot up to 27.1 percent in the week ended May 3. The agency explained the unemployment rate surge as the number of job seekers who couldn\u2019t find work. The labour participation rate rose from 35.4 percent in the week ended April 21 to 36.2 percent in the week ended May 3.The fall in March employment rates was just 2 percent compared with 2019-20 average of 404 million. But in April, the fall was 30 percent. This, according to CMIE, translates to 122 million job losses in April. Job losses are likely to continue in the absence of early recovery.Two, loans to the services sector are clearly at a higher risk in the backdrop of deterioration in services sector activity.According to the latest RBI data, banks have already seen a sharp decline in credit offtake to the services sector in March. Credit growth to the services sector decelerated sharply to 7.4 percent in March 2020 from 17.8 percent in March 2019. Banks have a loan outstanding of Rs 25.9 lakh crore. \u00a0With the services sector coming to a standstill, banks might see significant stress in the segment. Among the services, tourism, hotels and services have been impacted most by the lockdown. Banks have lent Rs 46,000 crore to this segment.Three, if the April trend in manufacturing and services continues, the Q1 GDP data is set to be a disappointment. The services sector contributes about 55 percent to the national GDP, followed by industries and agriculture.The Composite PMI Output Index, which measures combined services and manufacturing output, also sank to a new record low in April. At 7.2, the index fell from 50.6 in March and was indicative of an unprecedented decline in private sector business activity. The latest reading was the smallest by some margin, eclipsing the previous low seen in February 2009, the survey statement said.The nationwide lockdown that began on March 24 has been extended twice, this time until May 17. The near-stagnation in the economy has left small businesses and daily wage earners in a state of uncertainty. The government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package, which was followed up by the Reserve Bank of India with a few measures to ease liquidity constraints in the economy.

Hazira port in Gujarat was forced to close gates for imports and exports due to the port being completely congested.The container freight stations around JNPT Port in Mumbai has seen the evacuation of only about 61,000 Import TEUs with approximately another 77,000 TEUs still lying uncleared as of date.On April 27, DGS Amitabh Kumar had asked CSLA in a letter to share details of its member lines who are complying with the government order, citing complaints that carriers were not extending benefits to their customers.While shipping lines have been asked to waive off detention charges, most privately operated port terminals are not offering corresponding free time to the lines on port ground rent.Delay in clearances is likely to be detrimental to India's exports as ports, CFSs and ICDs have little space left to handle export volumes. The equipment of the lines is blocked with uncleared import cargo thereby leaving little in hand to cater to the export shipments.This would further get aggravated once the surge in the bookings happen, after the lockdown is lifted. This could thus impact the country\u2019s exports adversely, said Vaswani.CSLA India has asked for a rollback of the waiver of various charges, saying it should be left to shipping lines themselves to incentivise consignees for quick clearances rather than blanket waivers being ordered by the government each time for extended free periods.Currently, vessels essentially call just to discharge import loads and sail out light in view of negligible export bookings as export volumes have significantly\u00a0shrunk due to closure of the factories in India.As a result of increased per unit cost of operations for the vessels calling at Indian ports, 46 sailings of scheduled services had to be cancelled.The industry has sought\u00a0reduction in the Vessel Related Charges levied by the government by at least 30 per cent, over the current levels.

Quarterly revenues stood at Rs 1,496 crore, lower than the Rs 1,533 crore according to average of the estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.Operating profit of Rs 282 crore was slightly better than the poll estimate of Rs 278 crore, margins at18.8.9 percent were ahead of the poll estimate of 18.2 percent and profit after tax of Rs 199 crore too bettered the poll estimate of Rs 192 crore.Volume sales in the domestic market were down 3 percent, in line with analyst expectations of 2-3 percent.But more than the reported results, Marico\u2019s management commentary gave some valuable insights on what FMCG companies are expecting and the likely steps they will take, to navigate through the current crisis. Marico, like Hindustan Unilever, believes that near term demand is uncertain and consumer behaviour is likely to change.For instance, customers stocked up Saffola cooking oil and Saffola masala oats ahead of the lockdown, and they stocked down on parachute and other\u00a0 value added hair oils to minimise non-essential spends.The company, on its part, reduced advertising spends to protect margins.The HUL management had indicated in its results commentary last week that the sector was likely to see an upswing in categories like health, hygiene and nutrition. At the same time, there could be some adverse impact on discretionary categories and the out of home channel, in the short term.This reflects in Marico\u2019s recent brand extensions and product launches. With the rising consciousness among consumers about personal health and hygiene, the company introduced Medikerhand sanitizer last month. Distribution is being ramped up across all channels.Last month, the company also launched veggie clean, a first-of-its-kind fruit and vegetable cleaner, made with ingredients that remove all the germs, bacteria, chemicals, waxes and soil present on the surface of fruits and vegetables without leaving any residue, aftertaste or smell. Veggie Clean will be available across modern trade and e-commerce channels. In the last two months, we\u2019ve seen Emami, Dabur, Godrej Consumer and even Asian Paints enter the sanitizer space. One can expect more such innovations from FMCG companies going forward.FMCG Distribution has seen more challenges in the last five years than any other aspect of the business. With demonetization, GST, Army CSD restructuring and the advent of modern trade and\u00a0 e-commerce, companies have been constantly battling to strengthen their presence in each channel.The current COVID-19 crisis too, has thrown up a fresh set of challenges. While\u00a0 your neighbourhood kiranawala has demonstrated his importance, we are also thanking our stars for the BigBaskets and Grofers of the world.To cope up with the twin challenges of manpower and logistics, Marico joined forces with Zomato and Swiggy to use their platforms for direct delivery to customers. Following the nationwide lockdown, a tele-caller facility was set up to directly reach around 80,000 top retail outlets in the country and take orders from them.In order to ensure uninterrupted supplies to retailers, the company tied up with start-ups like Porter, Delhivery etc. It also introduced a direct to home delivery portal for consumers in select metro cities. This has been critical in ensuring business continuity during the crisis. With further acceleration in online shopping and online media consumption, Marico says it will continue to aggressively push for growth of the e-commerce business. While there may be no change in the manufacturing strategy, FMCG companies may have to take a relook at their stocking points to improve agility and execution in this environmentIn the last few years, premiumization and rising disposable income has been considered as the bedrock on which the great Indian consumer story rested. However, with an impending recession and expected decline in disposable incomes, there is a strong chance that customers will start cutting corners and settle for lower priced variants . Analysts say this would be the key near term risk for consumer companies. Marico\u2019s commentary does indicate that the concern is justified. They say, consumers are likely to be more value-seeking during this economic downturn, and so value pricing and small packs will be a key focus. Marico will also\u00a0 step back from premiumisation initiatives in the short term, even as preparatory work in terms of R&D and proposition building will continue behind the scenes.In the current scenario, with a decline in international crude prices and a prolonged slowdown in demand looking imminent, raw material costs are expected to be benign. However, to boost volumes and revenue, most companies are likely to pass on the benefits to consumers. This is clearly spelt out by Marico - it will choose to pass on the benefit to consumers and protect and grow volume growth across franchises. So a margin expansion looks unlikely, despite cheaper raw materials. Marico says it will strive to maintain the operating margin at FY20 levels.Crises accelerate innovation, necessitate creativity and inculcate a sense of discipline, agility and focussed approach for success in the market place. For FMCG companies, the parameters have been laid out clearly. Investors in the sector would be hoping that their companies come out of this wiser, stronger and bigger."], "tags": "#Business#company#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#India"},

Their return to these cities is as vital for their income as it is for engineering a rebound in India\u2019s service-led economy.On April 29, the Union Home Ministry allowed state governments to transport migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students, patients and others stranded due to the lockdown to their respective states from different parts of the country.They can travel by buses that some state governments have arranged. From May 1, theIndian Railways has started running special services\u2014Shramik Special trains\u2014to ferry stranded people home. These are point-to-point trains that are run at the request of the state governments.The first train carrying migrant workers left Lingampally in Telangana for Hatia in Jharkhand. It was followed by trains on other routes, such as Aluva to Bhubaneswar, Nashik to Lucknow, Nashik to Bhopal, Jaipur to Patna, and Kota to Hatia.It is the responsibility of the state governments to identify the stranded people who wish to travel back to their states. State governments have adopted different methods such as dedicated portals, telephone helplines and missed call registries for this purpose.Indian Railways has designated nodal officers to coordinate with states for \"sale of tickets, social distancing and other safety measures to be observed at train stations and within trains\".No. Only passengers who have been brought to the railway stations by government officials of the sending state will be allowed to board.The government had mandated that migrant workers returning home should be placed under home quarantine to protect the local population.The passengers have to be screened by the sending states and only those found without symptoms would be allowed to travel. Sending state governments have been asked to bring these persons in batches that can be accommodated in the train to the designated railway station in sanitised buses following social distancing norms and other precautionsMeals and drinking water are provided to the passengers by the sending states at the originating station. On longer routes, the Railways will provide a meal during the journey.These trains are carrying only 60 percent of the capacity due to social distancing norms. A team of paramedics and railway security officers are also accompanying the passengers in the train.Around 1,200 people are travelling on such a train.The Railways said it was bearing 85 percent of the fares and charging state governments the remaining 15 percent. It was for the respective state governments to bear this cost or get the travelling person to pay.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on May 4 launched a sharp attack on the government and the BJP, accusing the Centre of forcing migrant workers to pay for tickets. She said \"the Indian National Congress has, therefore, taken a decision that every Pradesh Congress Committee shall bear the cost for the rail travel of every needy worker and migrant labourer\".At least two Chief Ministers \u2013 Bihar's Nitish Kumar and Madhya Pradesh's Shivraj Singh Chouhan\u00a0\u2013 have said their governments will pay for the rail travel of stranded people returning to their states.The government of the state in which the destination is located is tasked with making all the arrangements for passenger screening and quarantine, if necessary, and provide last-mile connectivity for them to go home.India's rural areas and villages have been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak. There is a risk that people travelling back from cities, where the incidence of COVID-19 positive cases are very high, may have been infected and unknowingly end up spreading the virus in their villages. There have been several reports where villages have not allowed the migrant workers to return, insisting that they be quarantined.The lockdown's effect is very similar to a mechanical hard stop on a device that was running. What happens when the government asks factories to shut down because people have to be confined at home? What happens when the government asks construction activity to stop overnight because areas with large gatherings have to be emptied out? What happens when restaurants and shops, other than those selling essentials, are ordered to shutter down because people\u2019s physical proximity can add to the disease's spread?In such a situation, a restaurant, a retail garment seller, a property builder and a road builder will all show a similar first instinct: to cut costs. The temporary staff working at these establishments have been often the first ones to find themselves out of work.With many of them suddenly jobless, their incomes have dramatically collapsed. The uncertainty over when economic activity is likely to regain momentum has only deepened anxieties, prompting then to return home.Of India\u2019s workforce, around 90 percent is in the informal sector, millions of whom have migrated from their villages in search of a better living. In terms of sheer numbers, these inter-state migrants make up for a colossal magnitude, underlining their importance in India\u2019s economic structure.The Census 2011 pegs the total number of internal migrants in the country (accounting for inter- and intra-state movement) at a staggering 139 million.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the biggest source states, followed closely by Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and West Bengal. The major destination states are Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.\u00a0used monthly data on unreserved railway passenger traffic between every pair of stations in India for the years 2011-2016.The key idea was to use net annual flows of unreserved passenger travel as a proxy for work-related migrant flow. That data shows that such migration within India is between 5 and 9 million annually.The migrant worker population has led to growing domestic remittances market, estimated to exceed Rs. 1.5 lakh crores annually. Effectively, this implies that migrants working in urban areas are sending money back to their families in villages worth two-and-half-times the annual NREGA budget.These money transfers, from migrant labourers to villages, serve 10 percent of households in rural India and finance over 30 percent of household consumption in remittance-receiving households, buttressing the importance of urban growth for rural families.Therefore, an out-of-work migrant worker not just brings down his or her own income, but also, at a macro level, worsens prospects of the rural economy, as it brings down their ability to send money home.The Centre has sought to help these people stay put in their current places through welfare measures.On March 26, 2020, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package in an attempt to limit the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak and tackle the loss of livelihood of millions of poor hit by the lockdown.The relief package, under a newly framed Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana, aims to alleviate the financial pain faced by migrant workers, farmers, urban and rural poor and women.About 800 million people will get 5 kg of wheat or rice each month for three months for free over and above the 5 kg they already get.A one-time transfer of Rs 500 per month for next three months to the Jan Dhan accounts of 200 million women will be made, of which Rs 10,000 crore has already been deposited. Women of 83 million BPL families have also been provided free cooking gas cylinders for three months under the Ujjwala scheme.Collateral-free loans provided to women self-help groups have also been doubled to Rs 20 lakh for 6.3 million such groups, which will benefit 70 million households.The government is also bearing the cost of the provident fund contributions, both of the employer and employees\u201412 percent each\u2014until June, which have up to 100 employees and 90 percent of whom are earning less than Rs 15,000 per month as salary. More than 4.1 million people have benefited from this with government transferring about Rs 35,000 crore into the EPFO corpus.Provident fund scheme regulations have also been amended to allow non-refundable advance of 75 percent from the provident fund for contingency expenditure or three months of wages whichever is lower. Until now, 8.72 lakh people have availed this benefit, withdrawing more than Rs 2,700 crore.The central government has also directed state governments to use the existing welfare fund with Rs 34,000 crore reserves to provide assistance to 21 million construction workers to protect them from economic disruption.As the domestic remittances estimates show, it could well be economically rewarding if they managed to get back to work in the cities and towns that they were engaged in before the lockdown, only if appropriate welfare measures reach them."], "tags": "#coronavirus#Economy#India#migrant workers#video"},

They expect a wave of bankruptcies and a long period of high unemployment.At least 30 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits since mid-March when state and local government ordered nonessential workers to stay at home to slow the spread of COVID-19.In March, transportation equipment orders plunged 41.3 percent after increasing 4.6 percent in the prior month. Orders were weighed down by a 296.2 percent dive in demand for civilian aircraft and parts. Though Boeing said its aircraft orders rose in March relative to February, it also reported big cancellations of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which has been grounded since March 2019 following two fatal crashes.There was a 65.3 percent decline in orders for ships and boats in March. Motor vehicle and parts orders dropped 6.7 percent in March. That offset a 63.7 percent surge in orders for defense aircraft and parts. Machinery orders fell 0.5 percent in March after decreasing 1.1 percent in February. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components orders increased 0.8 percent in March.The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, dipped 0.1 percent in March instead of edging up 0.1 percent as reported last month.Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, fell 0.2 percent in March as previously reported."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#United States#World News"},

Today's ruling won't change that.\"But Luis Garicano, a Spanish liberal member of the European Parliament, said the ruling posed a threat to the future of EU institutions.\"Very worried about the future of Europe post (the verdict).

It is not just China, Europe and the United States; it is now spreading fast into Russia, Turkey, South Asia, West Asia and Latin America.Second, it has drastically reduced both demand and supply. When the governments themselves have directed industry and services to shut operations, traditional stimulus packages have little meaning.Now it is not just forecasts, actual GDP numbers for Q1 2020 for some major economies are out.

The economy was already weakening when lockdown started. Still, developing economies such as India, may perform slightly better. Agriculture and basic food items are lest affected by lockdowns. Also, a large number of people in these countries still depend on agriculture and spend significant part of their earnings on food items. India is also less integrated with global value chains.Since lockdowns started in March in many countries, a much bigger downturn is expected in the second quarter.

Some have gone to the extent of describing the present crisis as a potential 'Greater Depression'.The Great Depression of the 1930s at its peak led to 25 percent unemployment and 30 percent contraction in GDP in the US. This was, of course, the worst economic catastrophe of modern times. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed was the worst crisis after Great Depression.During that crisis also many experts had predicted that the global recession might aggravate into another depression that might last for several years. But this didn't happen. The unconventional ultra-loose monetary policy implemented by the leading central banks of the world facilitated a strong economic rebound. The US, particularly, experienced the longest period of economic expansion in history spanning more than 10 years.It is true that the present unprecedented 'Great Lockdown' has caused global unemployment, which is presently worse than that of the Great Depression. But this is forced unemployment; not the unemployment caused by economic collapse. Once the lockdown is lifted, unemployment will decline drastically. The unprecedented fiscal and monetary measures being implemented globally can prevent a Greater Depression.There is a near consensus among economists that the stock market crash of 1929 and the recession that followed aggravated into a depression due to monetary mismanagement. Fiscal stimulus as a counter-cyclical policy was unknown until Keynes popularized fiscal policy through his magnum opus \u2018The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\u2019 in 1936. In the initial years of the Great Depression President Hoover was trying to balance the budget.And the Fed, adhering to the Gold Standard, didn\u2019t expand money supply. In fact during 1930 to 1934 money supply in the US contracted and deflation led to very high real interest rates. At the peak of the Great Depression in 1932 deflation was 10.7 percent and real interest rate was 11.49 percent. The conservative Fed believed that bank failures are necessary for the stability of the financial system and allowed one third of the banks to fail. People started hoarding cash.Massive unemployment and hoarding of cash caused collapse in aggregate demand, triggering a vicious cycle of falling investment, rising unemployment, declining aggregate demand and collapse in growth.The present economic crisis caused by the Great Lockdown is unprecedented and hugely different from the Great Depression. The leading central banks, through Quantitative Easing, have ensured historically low interest rates - both nominal and real. Globally fiscal stimulus is at an unprecedented high level. This certainly will produce unintended negative consequences later. But for the present, the top priority is preventing an economic collapse.Economies will have to open up, whether the virus subsides or not. Present indications are that infections and mortality will peak in May facilitating phased opening up of economies. If that does not happen we will have to learn to live with the virus. Extended lockdown is not an option since that will prove to be a remedy worse than the disease. Economic recovery will not be V shaped; but a flat U shaped recovery is possible given the massive global fiscal stimulus and historically cheap money."], "tags": "#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#Expert Columns"},

It the sharpest deterioration in business conditions since data analytics firm IHS Markit began recording this metric 15 years ago.This development also does not augur well for Indian banks.Bankers and analysts expect significant spike in NPAs going ahead. The pain may not be visible immediately since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has\u00a0extended regulatory relaxations.But, that cushion won't be around for long.The moratorium period will end soon and companies and individual borrowers will have to resume repayments from June. With no business happening, workforce availability remaining an issue and rampant pay cuts, it is doubtful how many borrowers will have repayment capacity, bankers said.According to a report by ICRA, about 328 companies have sought moratorium from banks. That tells us about their financial position.\"It is quite obvious that we are not going to see improvement anytime soon. The worst part is that there is no assessment on the likely impact,\" said a senior banker.After a prolonged bad loan clean-up exercise, Indian banks' total gross NPAs stood at Rs 7.97 lakh crore as of December-end compared to Rs 8.02\u00a0 lakh crore a year ago.Banks are already giving distress signals to investors. On April 28, the mood at  media conference call after the bank's Q4 results was that of high caution. There was no clear guidance from top management on what lies ahead.\"If you look out of the window, all you can see is that the economic activities have come to a standstill,\" said chief executive officer, Amitabh Chaudhury.What caught analysts by surprise was the unexpected Rs 3,000 crore (out of the Rs 7,730 crore total provisions) provisions set aside\u00a0to cover the likely impact of COVID-19. The signal was clear.Not just Axis, most other banks expect the likelihood of slippages this year due to the debilitating impact of COVID-19. Private banks like  and  have presented a relatively optimistic scenario while large state-run banks are largely silent on future outlook.\"It is almost certain that the industry will see a big spike in bad loans. A number of companies are feeling the heat.\u00a0This stress is not reflecting so far because of the present RBI relaxations such as moratorium on loan payments. But, once this is lifted, the real picture will emerge,\"\u00a0said Siddarth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global Securities.According to RBI's credit growth data, there was a spike in bank lending in March, particularly in the last fortnight of March in some sectors like non-banking finance companies and industries. But, analysts said some of this growth could be due to earlier sanctions. Still, the overall growth largely remain subdued on a YoY basis.The central bank has announced a slew of measures to help banks and borrowers tide over this crisis. In the first round of measures, RBI announced a 75 basis point rate cut, liquidity measures to the tune of Rs 3.74 lakh crore, including a targeted long term repo operation (TLTRO) worth Rs 1 lakh crore, deferment of interest on working capital facilities and three month moratorium for all term loans extended by lending institutions. In the second round, the it announced TLTRO 2.0 worth Rs 50,000 crore, specifically targeting small companies.The last credit cycle for banks had seen sharp surge in bad loans. Indian banks are at the end of a prolonged NPAs clean-up cycle. The hidden stock of bad loans buried deep in the balance sheets, accumulated over the years of easy money era, prompted the RBI to initiate an Asset Quality Review (AQR) in 2015. By now, that process is almost over with banks having disclosed most of the problematic large corporate accounts. Many large cases of corporate loan defaults have been pushed to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) court for quicker resolution.But, with the economic activities reduced to nil, it is highly unlikely that there will be buyers for stressed assets, bankers said. In the last round, certain large deals such as Rs 35,000 crore Tata Steel-Bhushan helped bankers recoup some losses.Among the loan categories, fresh loans given to companies including those given to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face risk if the cash flows of companies remain under pressure, thus impacting their loan repayment ability, bankers said.\"There is only so much you can do when economy is not doing well. Lending and recovery depend on economic recovery on the ground,\" said Naresh Malhotra, a banking consultant.Banks remain highly risk averse and the consensus among industry leaders is that most companies in consumer-oriented sectors at the moment are now operating with less than 70 percent of their capacity.

The scheme was recently extended till December 3, 2020, after the government requested the RBI to do so.NBFCs have now asked RBI to extend a similar scheme for their borrowers for all types of loans taking into account the COVID-19 situation.\u201cOur key demand was permission for a one-time restructuring of loans of all borrowers. We also raised the moratorium issue with the RBI since some banks are still not extending a moratorium to NBFCs,\u201d said one NBFC industry official.If RBI permits this demand, this will be a big relief to NBFC borrowers since economic activities have slowed to a trickle on account of the prolonged lockdown.Secondly, NBFCs have also asked the RBI to intervene to ensure banks give back-to-back-moratorium to NBFCs. The RBI announced moratorium for all term loans on 27 March. While NBFCs have extended this facility to their borrowers, not all banks have extended this facility to NBFCs.

In a similar meeting, the RBI had met banks a few days ago to discuss industry issues.NBFC-MFIs told the RBI that smaller companies are unable to access the targeted long term repo operation (TLTRO) funds since banks are risk-averse, and hence, a separate window for small NBFCs and MFIs should be opened. This window can be routed through Nabard and Sidbi for smaller NBFC-MFIs, industry representatives demanded.Also, in view of the Covoid-19 situation, RBI should allow all companies to avail the benefit of liquidity schemes regardless of their size and rating, NBFC-MFIs told RBI. As of now, the RBI liquidity windows can be used by banks to lend to those companies with minimum investment grading (BBB-).

Business failures destroy wealth and depress investment. Cheap money and cash transfers risk fuelling asset bubbles that widen the gap between rich and poor.\"It gets to the question: At what point are we worried with just how much a role the Fed is playing?\" said Kathryn Judge, a Columbia Law School professor who studies financial markets.\"If they are the only actor and people are worried about liquidity and access to finance, how much pressure comes to bear? Longer term it is disconcerting.\"The Bank of England announced in May that it would buy more government bonds just as Britain's Treasury said it would incur more debt to pay the wages of laid-off workers.BoE policymaker Jan Vlieghe said the unprecedented coordinated action resembled what might happen \"if we were the central bank of the Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe\", both disastrous examples of government ordering central banks around. The difference, Vlieghe said, was that no one in the government told the BoE what to do.But what if they didn't have to, because such cooperation had become an unspoken new orthodoxy?Japan is arguably at that point.A decades-long fight against deflation -- a chronic drop in prices that causes incomes and economic growth to fall -- has seen the Bank of Japan steadily increase its footprint.It now owns nearly half of all Japanese government bonds, and last week agreed to buy as much as needed during the crisis.The BOJ, which in February owned 4.7 percent of Japan's corporate bond market and about 10 percent of the shorter-term corporate loans known as commercial paper, also expanded corporate debt purchases.\"We aren't monetising government debt,\" Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, but buying what is needed under the BOJ's policy of \"yield curve control\" -- basically it way keeping interest rates low.In Europe and the United States, similar \"unconventional\" policy tools were used in 2008 to fight a financial crisis that spilled into the real economy.The Fed bought about $4 trillion of government bonds to lower borrowing costs and used other means to keep markets flush with cash and remove soured mortgages from lenders' books.The previously unused measures, which helped preserve jobs and support growth, were meant to be exceptional.But the shock of the coronavirus is pushing the boundaries further.The repercussions for some European economies, notably Italy, have been so severe that analysts expect the European Central Bank to use its broad power to enact a rescue.One way would be if politicians agree to put Italy or possibly the entire currency union in an emergency programme that would allow the ECB to finance national debts under a scheme known as Outright Monetary Transactions.\"It's a given that OMT will be activated,\" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, adding: \"Once OMT is in place, it will be a perpetual situation.\"ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that its \"flexible\" Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme was a better tool for the current situation than OMT, an unused relic of the previous crisis.The Fed did close down the various emergency and \"bailout\" programs it launched to deal with the 2007-2009 crisis -- at a profit to the US Treasury -- and hopes to avoid making any enduring commitments this time.It has added about $2.5 trillion to its holdings since the crisis began, giving it assets of $6.7 trillion as of last week. Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli said he expects that total to peak around $9 trillion and be declining by year-end as conditions stabilize and loans are repaid.Demand for three initial Fed facilities for bond and money markets has been just $90 billion so far.But without a vaccine or clear virus suppression, central banks may just be getting started. The Fed, which helped financial institutions in the last crisis, is already buying corporate bonds, lending to state and local governments, and agreeing to fund up to 95 percent of bank loans to potentially thousands of businesses.Even before they are up and running, the programs have been expanded to reach more and riskier borrowers, including some downgraded \"fallen angel\" corporations, smaller cities and counties, and more highly leveraged companies.All these changes rely on loss-covering capital from the Treasury -- whose debts the Fed has pledged to buy in whatever amounts the Fed feels are needed.Private sector debt in the United States totaled about $32 trillion late last year, while the federal government's debt is around $24 trillion, compared with 2019 GDP of $21.7 trillion.The numbers are big. But so are the promises.\"We're still putting out the fire. We're still trying to win.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and member of the White House coronavirus task force, said in late April that it is conceivable, if a vaccine is soon developed, that it could be in wide distribution as early as January.Though the administration's handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president tried to shift the blame to China and said the U.S. was ready to begin reopening.\u201cI'll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,\u201d the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was \u201ctoo soon to say\" the federal government had overseen a \u201csuccess story.\" While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, Trump said that \u201csome states, frankly, I think aren't going fast enough.\" He singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation's schools and universities to return to classes this fall.Federal guidelines that encouraged people to stay at home and practice social distancing expired late last week.Debate continued over moves by governors to start reopening state economies that tanked after shopping malls, salons and other nonessential businesses were ordered closed in attempt to slow a virus that has killed more than 66,000 Americans, according to a tally of reported deaths by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. economy has suffered, shrinking at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March, the government estimated last week. And roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since the outbreak forced employers to shut down and slash their workforces.The president's advisers have nervously watched Trump's support slip in a number of battleground states and he was told last month that if the election were held that day, he would lose to Democrat Joe Biden. The president's aides believe restarting the economy, even with its health risks, is essential to a victory in November and are pushing for him to pivot away from discussions about the pandemic and onto an American comeback story.To that end, Trump will begin traveling again, with a trip to a mask factory in Arizona planned for Tuesday. The president also is set to speak in June at commencement for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Returning to campus for commencement will require graduates to self-isolate for 14 days, but Trump insisted the event poses no risk to the cadets.The town hall, which included an appearance by Vice President Mike Pence, included a rare mea culpa: The vice president said he should have worn a face mask during a visit last week to Minnesota's Mayo Clinic. Pence's failure to wear a mask violated the clinic's guidelines and drew significant criticism.Elsewhere in Washington, the Senate planned to reopen Monday, despite the area's continued status as a virus hot spot and with the region still under stay-at-home orders.

Construction activity that were ordered shut overnight because areas with large gatherings were to be emptied out, can now resume work under certain conditions.Domestic helps, carpenters, electricians, AC and car mechanics and all such self-employed service providers can also return to work, if local resident associations agree to let them in their areas. People have also been allowed to order food and other products on e-commerce platforms, and cab aggregators can resume services in several areas.These are gingerly taken, tentative steps towards rebooting the Indian economy, which until recently, was an engine for global growth and had set its sights on the turning in with $5 trillion GDP in a few years from now.A key characteristic of the Indian economy is the services sector\u2019s influence in both depth and breadth. The services sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of India\u2019s economy.It is not just about the storied software companies that have fuelled aspirations and prosperity among the middle-class. The Indian services sector is also as much about those who have moved hundreds of kilometres from their villages to eke out a living beneath cityscapes as roadside tea vendors, vegetable sellers, newspaper hawkers, domestic helps, drivers, cobblers and construction workers.Of India\u2019s workforce, 90 percent is in the informal sector, millions of whom have migrated from their villages in search of a better living. In terms of sheer numbers, these inter-state migrants make up for a colossal magnitude, underlining their importance in India\u2019s economic structure.The Census 2011 pegs the total number of internal migrants in the country (accounting for inter- and intra-state movement) at a staggering 139 million.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the biggest source states, followed closely by Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and West Bengal; the major destination states are Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. gives a fascinating insight into India\u2019s internal migration. It used monthly data on unreserved railway passenger traffic between every pair of stations in India for the years 2011-2016.The key idea was to use net annual flows of unreserved passenger travel as a proxy for work-related migrant flow. This class of travel serves less affluent people, who are more likely to travel for work-related reasons.It is also relatively unconstrained by capacity, hence reflecting the demand for travel, whereas reserved passenger traffic is more likely to be constrained by the supply of seats. That data shows that such migration within India is between 5 and 9 million annually.This may have accelerated in recent years with higher growth in the construction sector and a host of economic opportunities as more areas get urbanised.This has also spawned a bustling domestic remittances market, estimated to exceed Rs 1.5 lakh-crore annually. Effectively, this implies that migrants working in urban areas are sending money back to their families in villages worth two-and-half-times the annual NREGA budget.These money transfers, from migrant labourers to villages, serve 10 percent of households in rural India and finance over 30 percent of household consumption in remittance-receiving households, buttressing the importance of urban growth for rural families.The movement of migrant workers back to their villages need to be seen in this context. As the domestic remittances estimates, it could well be economically rewarding if they managed to get back to work in the cities and towns that they were engaged in before the lockdown.The Centre, to be sure, have sought help these people stay put in their current places, through welfare measures.On March 26, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out a Rs 1.7 lakh-crore relief package, in an attempt to limit the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak and tackle the loss of livelihood of millions of poor hit by the lockdown.The relief package, under a newly-framed Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana, aims to alleviate the financial pain faced by migrant workers, farmers, urban and rural poor and women.About 800 million people will get 5 kg of wheat or rice each month for three months for free over and above the 5 kg they already get.A one-time transfer of Rs 500 per month for next three months to the Jan Dhan accounts of 200 million women will be made, of which Rs 10,000 crore has already been deposited. Women of 83 million BPL families have also been provided free cooking gas cylinders for three months under the Ujjwala scheme.Collateral-free loans provided to women self-help groups have also been doubled to Rs 20 lakh for 6.3 million such groups, which will benefit 70 million households.The government is also bearing the cost of the provident fund contributions, both of the employer and employees \u2014 12 percent each \u2014 until June, which have up to 100 employees and 90 percent of whom are earning less than Rs 15,000 per month as salary. More than 4.1 million people have benefited from this with government transferring about Rs 35,000 crore into the EPFO corpus.Provident fund scheme regulation have also been amended to allow non-refundable advance of 75 percent from the provident fund for contingency expenditure or three months of wages whichever is lower. Until now, 8.72 lakh people have availed this benefit, withdrawing more than Rs 2,700 crore.The central government has also directed state governments to use the existing welfare fund with Rs 34,000 crore reserves to provide assistance to 21 million construction workers to protect them from economic disruption."], "tags": "#coronavirus#Covid-19#Indian economy#migrant workers#migratns#welfare schemes"},

But like it is with every crisis, this pandemic too may throw up opportunities for buyers as several cash-starved developers with unsold inventory may be forced to sell at discounted prices.While luxury housing may see a 20 percent reduction in prices, developers would offer freebies to buyers investing in the mid segment. These may range from deferred payment plans to even a free Corona insurance that may address their fears of a job loss. Affordable housing may see a moderate price correction of 5 percent and also a fall in volume.For instance, a villa property in Mumbai's Worli area is in the market for a few months now. The buyer had bought it for around Rs 40 crore a few years ago and was willing to sell it for about Rs 30 crore four months ago. Today, he is willing to sell it at Rs 20 crore and yet there are no takers. This is almost at a price point of Rs 30,000 per sq ft, which is comparable to a high-end property in Gurgaon's Golf Course Road. Chairman\u00a0Deepak Parekh recently said that he sees a 20 per cent drop in property prices of unsold residential inventory, and advised developers to offload their stocks to enhance liquidity position. He also cautioned developers against over leveraging, which can affect their businesses in the long-run.A report by HDFC Securities had noted that large NBFCs expect further 20-25 percent cuts in the real estate prices and a 25-30 percent dip in volumes for the financial year 2021 along with fiscal incentives like stamp duty waivers. This shall aid demand recovery. The market may consolidate in the hands of select large organised developers with strong balance sheet and access to bank funding. JDA/JV model will continue and land buying will take a back seat. Launches will get deferred and focus will be on completing existing unsold area.An analysis by Liases Foras has also predicted that property prices may come down by 10-20 percent across geographies, while land prices could see an even higher reduction of 30 percent.Luxury real estate projects are bound to witness a reduction in prices across the country, anything from 10 to 20 percent depending on the location, city and the demand supply situation. These are units priced at Rs 2.5 crore and above, say real estate experts.In the mid-segment category where units are priced between Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore, there may be a slight correction as developers may instead decide to offer freebies instead of direct discounts.What's important to understand here is that this segment is popular with the fence sitters. The builder community may try to get into a demand boosting exercise to motivate this segment to buy.\"Reduction in prices or discounts alone may not be a motivator for this segment. The developer may decide to entice them with intelligent freebies,\" said an expert.Builders going forward may decide to address this segment's chief fears which include a job loss three months down the line, a probably reduction in price or \"what happens if I get corona\".Experts said that real estate builders would have to think innovatively to generate cashflows.\"The biggest challenge in the market today is the revival of demand. That can be achieved either by reducing property prices, bringing down the cost of financing or mortgage rates and introducing a better tax structure for both direct and indirect taxes,\" said Anckur Srivasttava of GenReal Advisers.Builders may promise a price guarantee option to boost sales. This means that if a house is worth Rs 1 crore and if prices were to come down in a few months or the buyer were to lose his job, the developer as per this scheme, decide to buy back the house from the buyer and also offer a 6 percent interest on the amount.This could ensure that the buyer not only gets back his money but also an amount equivalent to what he would have earned had he parked his money in a fixed deposit. A win-win proposition.Some builders may decide to offer a Corona insurance for the entire family.\"Such schemes would go a long way in addressing fears of a job loss, fear of value erosion of a property and most important the fear of contracting the disease itself,\" said Srivasttava.The buyer pool may shrink going forward but discounts alone may not do the trick. Deferred payment plans without subvention may become popular.\"One may see developers coming up with deferred payment plans such as 10:90 plan which means that the buyer may have to pay an upfront amount of 10 percent and 90 percent at the time of possession.\u00a0Such payment plans may also be offered for ready-to-move-in projects,\" said Mudassir\u00a0Zaidi, Executive Director- North,\u00a0Knight Frank\u00a0India.This means that the buyer may have to pay 10 percent at the time of moving in and perhaps the remaining 90 percent within a year.The sub-Rs 50 lakh segment may also see a correction of 5 percent, say experts.The Rs 10 lakh to Rs 45 lakh segment may also witness a moderate correction with some freebies thrown in.\"This segment may also see a volume correction because of significant demand erosion as the savings of these people have been eroded during the lockdown,\" said an expert.Some experts are of the view that real estate prices have remained stable for the last five years and with time correction already having taken place, developers may not have enough head room to reduce prices.\"Homebuyers' resistance to prices is much less today. The bigger issue is that of timely delivery and quality of the product being offered,\" said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS,\u00a0JLL\u00a0India.Going forward, some developers may decide to offer well-designed compact units to fit the buyers\u2019 pocket.Developers may also offer freebies such as GST and stamp duty waivers, additional gadgets in the house such as dishwashers thrown in. There may not be enough headroom to rationalise prices as prices have remained stable for almost five years now, he added.In 2008, the real estate market was over heated. It had short-term investors and under writers, making it a sellers\u2019 market. The price bubble led to reduction of prices by 20 percent to 30 percent. Developers\u2019 have had a bull\u2019s run five year\u2019s prior to the Lehman\u2019s crisis and their coffers were full. They therefore had enough head room to reduce prices.Today, it is an end-users\u2019 market. The market has been in slow mode for the last five years due to several reasons. It is still trying to come to terms with disruptions like RERA, GST implementation and the NBFC funding crisis.The coronavirus outbreak is perhaps the fourth 'Black Swan' event being witnessed by the Indian real estate sector in since 2016, according to a report by\u00a0ICICI Securities.Recovery after the 2008 slowdown was faster as builders had enough buffer. In the present situation, prices have stagnated or come down significantly for the last five years. Despite prices being affordable, buyers are still cautious of investing in property. Timely delivery is their main fear.In a crisis situation like today, a developer offering a 20 percent discount would also have its own set of challenges, says an expert.\"Homebuyers are wary of buying a high-ticket item such as a house. There are serious confidence and trust issues. A developer offering 20 percent upfront discount would be looked at with suspicion. There could be perception issues. Having said that, there may still be buyers, employed with sectors that are expected to do well such as FMCG, e-commerce, telecom, pharma, insurance, who may still want to buy property post the pandemic,\" added Zaidi."], "tags": "#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#Housing#India#Real Estate"},

But as is the case at other struggling companies, some workers are suffering more than others.They are often the ones who earned the least to begin with.Faced with collapsing sales, Lufthansa agreed to take full advantage of a government subsidy program that, combined with money from the company, provides furloughed workers with 90 percent of their normal net pay. The subsidy alone would have provided them 60 percent to 67 percent.That was nice, except it did not apply to the crews for SunExpress, which is a joint venture between Lufthansa and Turkish Airways and offers budget flights to Mediterranean holiday spots.SunExpress employees, who already are paid less than Lufthansa workers, will receive a lesser deal while furloughed: 75 percent of their net pay, or 82 percent for those with children.About 27,000 Lufthansa cabin and ground personnel are covered by the agreement. SunExpress has about 1,200 employees in Germany, giving them far less political influence.Lufthansa is an example of how corporate cost-cutting in Europe is falling hardest on people at the low end of the pay scale, despite strong unions and strict labor laws.\u201cThe ones who were already weak, who already had worse working conditions, are now the ones that suffer,\u201d said Mira Neumaier, head of the civil aviation team at the German service workers union known as Ver.di.Airlines, retailers and many other industries are in dire shape after lockdowns that brought much of the global economy to a standstill. They have to drastically cut costs. Lufthansa last week asked for government bailouts after passenger traffic dwindled to almost nothing and it lost more than 1 billion euros in the first quarter.Lufthansa\u2019s agreements with workers are intended \u201cto keep as many employees on board as possible,\u201d J\u00f6rg Waber, a Lufthansa spokesman, said in an emailed statement.But Neumaier said the savings to the airline from treating some employees worse than others is out of proportion to the burden on individual workers. A SunExpress flight attendant typically earns less than 2,000 euros (or $2,200) a month before taxes, according to worker representatives.For some employees, she said, \u201cit will really make a difference whether they can pay their rent or not.\u201dAt some companies, cost-cutting means targeting the workers who can be fired with the least fuss or who have the least clout in the labour market.WrenKitchens, which describes itself as Britain\u2019s largest kitchen retailer, fired hundreds of employees in March, including many trainees and recent hires, saying their performance was not up to par. Had WrenKitchens furloughed the workers instead of firing them, the British government would have covered 80 percent of their pay.\u201cIt\u2019s a family business; they should understand that they\u2019re putting a lot of families in difficult situations,\u201d said Leo Ismail, 28, a trainee who lost his job.Ismail, who has a 17-month-old son, said he had enough savings to last a month.Unite, a British labor union, called WrenKitchens\u2019 behavior \u201cappalling.\u201d\u201cThat this happened when the government has guaranteed the wages of furloughed workers makes Wren\u2019s behavior particularly cruel,\u201d Mike Wilkinson, a union official, said in a statement.WrenKitchens did not respond to requests for comment.There are increasing reports that some employers are abusing subsidized furlough programs, pocketing the government money while continuing to pressure employees to work.In France, more than 900,000 firms have put 8 million employees on \u201cpartial unemployment,\u201d a government program like the ones in Germany and Britain designed to make sure people have incomes while their companies are shuttered.The French government reimburses employers about 84 percent of their workers\u2019 net salaries on the condition that the employees don\u2019t telecommute or perform other work full time. Many employers cover a portion of the remaining lost wages.But some French employees say they are being required to report to work even though their employer is collecting the subsidy.\u201cWe have cases where salespeople, gardeners and retail employees are being told to work\u201d when their company has enrolled in the subsidy program, said Elie Lambert, the national secretary of the National Solidarity Union, a trade union representing workers in all sectors of the economy.\u201cOr they\u2019re told, \u2018If you don\u2019t want the company to die, you\u2019ll work anyway,\u2019 \u201d said Lambert, whose group has collected hundreds of complaints on a nationwide hotline in recent weeks.The reports have grown so numerous that the French Labor Ministry has threatened steep fines and jail time for employers fraudulently abusing the system.Freelancers and temp workers are particularly vulnerable when companies go looking for places to save.IBM\u2019s Dutch unit told freelancers and contractors that they would have to accept a 25 percent cut in their compensation or be fired, RTL Z, a Dutch business channel, reported. IBM said in a statement that, in the interests of employing as many people as possible, \u201cwe are taking various actions involving some of our contractor workforce.\u201dIn Germany, supermarkets have hired temporary security guards to limit the number of shoppers who are inside at any given time, in line with lockdown requirements. The Ver.di union has complained that these workers are being underpaid in violation of wage agreements.An association that represents security firms has told its members that the supermarket guards are entitled only to the German minimum wage of 9.35 euros an hour, rather than the wage negotiated with unions, according to Ver.di.The union wage is not that much higher, ranging from 10.60 euros an hour in some eastern German states to 11 euros in parts of western Germany.Security firms argue that people controlling traffic at supermarkets are more akin to ushers at a sports event than security guards and therefore not entitled to as much pay. Silke Z\u00f6ller, a spokeswoman for the industry association that supplies and pays security guards, said that the minimum wage would apply only to a narrow subset of workers not covered by wage agreements.Some of these inequalities will disappear when lockdowns ease, as is already happening in Germany and other places. But some of the damage is permanent.Lufthansa initially agreed to pay 1,100 furloughed employees of Germanwings, another budget subsidiary, 90 percent of their pay \u2014 the same amount as workers at the parent company. But then Lufthansa decided to fold the unit, which has long had financial trouble. That means the employees are no longer eligible for the pay they would have received on furlough and must apply for unemployment benefits, which are usually lower.Lufthansa said it hoped to find jobs for Germanwings employees elsewhere in the company.At the same time, Lufthansa has also asked for government aid, warning that its existence is at stake and hinting that it may not be able to pay any furloughed employees more than they get from the government. Worker representatives said they planned to push political leaders to make any support conditional on better treatment of employees of the airline\u2019s subsidiaries.\u201cOn the one side they ask for help for the state, and on the other side they refuse to top up salaries,\u201d said Daniel Flohr, a Lufthansa flight attendant who is also chairman of the Independent Organization of Flight Attendants, known in German as UFO. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d"], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Europe#labour#news service#world"},

It was the biggest drop in the eurozone since statistics began in 1995 and compares to a 4.8\u00a0percent contraction in the United States.Lockdowns that turned major European cities into ghost towns are plunging nations into recession.

Apart from the spending measures, there can be others like loan guarantees also, it said.Joshi explained that countries having more fiscal space can afford to have longer lockdowns, while those like India with limited room will have to gradually open up to support the economy, and added that the containment measures should ease off by June.However, the agency seemed to suggest that India Inc will be badly impacted due to the crisis.\u201cThis is unprecedented and the numbers that we are estimating are historic, which you would like to forget sooner,\u201d CRISIL Research's senior director Prasad Koparkar said.Koparkar said CRISIL did an analysis of 800 firms across sectors and came out with estimates for the FY21.It expects India Inc's revenue growth to fall 8-10 percent in the base case of 1.8 percent growth and slide further to 12-15 percent if the GDP is stagnant.The more pronounced impact will be on profitability as it expects a 15-18 percent decline in operating profit margins in the base case, which can go up to 30 percent in the downside scenario.As a result of this, credit metrics are set to weaken during the fiscal, CRISIL said, pointing out that the level of the Rs 16 lakh crore corporate debt that stands the risk of slipping into being stressed will go up to 32 percent from the earlier level of 22 percent.Koparkar said bank credit growth will slow down to 2-3 percent and the retail segment, which had held on in the last few years, will also slow down as housing, auto and commercial vehicle sales suffer.The heightened stress and the slow credit growth will take the overall NPAs to up to 11.5 percent, a level last seen in FY18 after the asset quality review of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The NPAs will be higher both on fresh slippages and also slower resolutions through mechanisms like National Company Law Tribunals, it said.Without giving a number, Koparkar said NPAs in the retail segment will also rise as the spectre of unemployment plays out.From a sectoral perspective, it said auto components, real estate, gems and jewellery, construction, airlines, textiles, poultry and meat business will suffer the most, while pharma, telecom and direct to home players in media will be the least impacted.For telecom, the research is estimating a double-digit revenue growth on the back of the 40 percent hike in tariffs last year, Koparkar said."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Crisil#Economy#India#India Inc"},

The economy had grown at a 2.1% pace in the final three months of 2019.What no one is expecting from Fed policymakers at this meeting is a detailed forecast for the economy, given the uncertainty around the impact of the virus before a treatment or a vaccine can be found.\"We are not expecting any discussion of the outlook, as it remains unknowable,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan.An increasing number of US states are reopening their economies or at least setting out plans for easing stay-at-home restrictions, leading to fears there could be a resurgence of infections over the coming months and a headache for the Fed as it seeks to estimate the swiftness of the economic recovery.The Fed's rate-setting committee, which is meeting by videoconference, is scheduled to issue its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to hold a separate videoconference with journalists half an hour later.The statement is likely to reflect a sharp downgrade in the Fed's assessment of the job market, household spending, energy markets and the outlook for inflation since its last meeting in March, before most US states had done much to curtail economic activity and put the brakes on the exploding outbreak.It may also offer clues as to how long the central bank expects to keep supporting the economy.\"We expect the committee to lay down specific inflation and unemployment thresholds that would need to be met before the committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate,\" economists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.The Fed did exactly that for about a year starting in December 2012, in the aftermath of the last recession, an approach that research has since suggested helped keep financial conditions loose and hastened a faster recovery.Last month, the Fed said only that it will keep rates near zero \"until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\"It slashed rates to near-zero in March and rolled out a mix of new and refurbished crisis programs aimed at shoring up credit markets and backstopping companies and local governments reeling from forced shutdowns and sharp drops in revenue.While not expected to launch any new programs, Powell will likely be asked about options for further action, given his comments last month that the Fed \"is not going to run out of ammunition.\"Those possibilities include further bond-buying coupled with targeting specific longer-term borrowing costs like 10-year bond yields. Several Fed officials have also signaled an openness to helping other segments of the economy, including non-profit organizations and mortgage servicers, that have been largely left out of current programs.Earlier this week, the Fed broadened its previously announced support for local governments.The depth of the economic slowdown is starting to become clear, with more than 26 million people filing new claims for unemployment benefits since March 21. But the Fed and other analysts are still trying to get a handle on the likely shape of the recovery.Most US states still have stay-at-home measures, though a handful are beginning to reopen even as cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness that has killed more than 57,000 people in the United States, continue to grow.Many health experts have also begun to predict a seasonal resurgence of COVID-19 in the fall, whatever containment measures are put in place, raising the possibility that stay-at-home restrictions may need to be reintroduced, and with them, a new downturn in economic growth.In its policy statement, the Fed may also roll out a technical change to how it sets rates, increasing slightly the interest it pays on the excess reserves that banks hold at the central bank.Some analysts speculated it will do so at this week's meeting in order to keep the effective federal funds rate - the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate - within target, but others think an adjustment now would be premature.

This was later extended till May 3.As per the terms and conditions of property/fire insurance products, the cover ceases to exist if the premises are unoccupied for a period of 30 days.Due to the lockdown, factories/warehouses and commercial establishments have been unoccupied since March 25. While insurers have said COVID-19 will be treated as a special situation and cover will not be explicitly denied, a lot of restrictions have been attached. Moneycontrol had how a slew of conditions has been set to the existing policies.Insurer\u2019s consent also has to be taken in advance for policy size of over Rs 5 crore where a decision will be taken by the insurance company on a case-to-case basis whether the cover will be extended or not.The IBAI letter, which has been reviewed by Moneycontrol, said policyholders are concerned about the withdrawal of cover or imposition of new onerous conditions and warranties for continuity of coverage.\u201cThe policyholders are complaining that the absence of any competition is leading to a multifold increase in insurance premiums (with all insurers quoting the same price in a de-tariffed market), application of COVID-19 exclusions unilaterally, and now, coverage continuity being put under doubt,\u201d it said in the letter.Insurers have advised various policyholders based on the guidance received from GIC Re that continuity of cover is subject to compliance of specified conditions during lockdown period and prior written approval of insurer needs to be taken for continuity of cover.The fire insurance rates for 291 occupancies from January 1 onwards.

Premiums have been paid on time. Incidentally, fire insurance rates were also increased by almost 30 percent by our insurer. But we still may not get claims paid for this period,\u201d said the chief executive of an appliance maker.This means that in case of a fire or theft in large commercial premises (with insurance above Rs 5 crore) during a lockdown, claims will not be paid unless prior consent has been sought.Insurance companies are following the advisory by GIC Re on this matter which said that business interruption cover will not be applicable for the lockdown period. Due to this, more than Rs 5,000 crore of revenue/financial loss due to COVID-19 lockdown will not be payable by insurance companies.Business interruption (BI) cover usually pays for disruption in business/production activity in a building or commercial establishment due to fire, floods, earthquake or other natural disasters.\u201cThe blanket advisory to not cover business interruption is not rational. Policyholders are afraid that the blanket advisory of GIC Re indicating that there is no BI cover in property policies and no advance loss of profit cover in project policies defies accepted principles of BI loss adjustment,\u201d said IBAI.The letter also pointed out that such blanket exclusions and advisories have not yet been provided for insurance claims in other markets. The entire globe is impacted by COVID-19 where businesses have been ordered to temporarily shut operations.IBAI wants the IRDAI to issue necessary directions.

A clothing store clerk gave up his gym membership. An events planner, his pay cut by four-fifths, now moonlights as a takeout delivery driver \u2014 and can no longer afford to eat out.China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a key driver of the global growth engine, has a big problem with its spenders. Until it can be solved, the country\u2019s growth \u2014 and, by extension, the world\u2019s \u2014 will be difficult to rekindle.As the coronavirus outbreak ebbs in China, the country\u2019s companies and officials have made big strides in restarting its economy. Its factories, brought to a standstill when the coronavirus outbreak swept through the country in January, are humming again, and even the air pollution is coming back.Empowering consumers could be the tougher task. Many lost their jobs or had their pay slashed. Still others were shaken by weeks of idleness and home confinement, a time when many had to depend on their savings to eat. For a generation of young Chinese people known for their American-style shopping sprees, saving and thrift hold a sudden new appeal.Chloe Cao, a Beijing translator of French stage dramas, once spent more than $200 a month in restaurants, $70 a month in coffee shops and as much as $170 for a tube of imported face cream. Now unemployed, she cooks for herself, brews her own coffee and buys $28 Chinese face cream.\u201cMy spending power has suffered a clifflike drop,\u201d Cao said. \u201cWhen I find a job, I will start saving money, and I can\u2019t live a wasteful life like before.\u201dChina\u2019s consumer confidence problem offers potential lessons for the United States and Europe, which are only beginning to plan their recoveries. Even if companies reopen, the real challenge may lie in enabling or persuading stricken and traumatized consumers to start spending money again.By some measures, China\u2019s economy is getting back on track. By the end of February, most of its factories and mines had reopened, according to a variety of data, cranking out everything from steel to cellphones at a blistering pace through March. Industrial output rebounded to a near-record level.Other measures suggest the Chinese economy is still limping. Retail sales, which stayed strong during past crises, plummeted almost one-sixth in March from a year earlier.Satellite imagery shows that Chinese industrial areas emitted considerably less light this spring than they did a year ago, in a sign that fewer building sites may be floodlit for 24-hour construction and that fewer factories may be operating around the clock.Even the factory work that has resumed may not be dependable for long. Customers in the United States and Europe also are not buying Chinese-made goods like they once did. US department stores, for example, have been canceling and postponing orders.China\u2019s unemployment statistics \u2014 which showed a 5.9% urban unemployment rate in March \u2014 are notoriously unreliable. Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Securities, an Australian investment bank, estimates that China\u2019s urban unemployment rate will nearly double this year. True unemployment may be as high as 20% if migrant workers from rural areas are included, according to one estimate from Zhongtai Securities, a Chinese brokerage.Overall sales of furniture, clothing, household appliances and jewelry each plunged by a quarter to a third in March compared a year earlier. On the street and in malls, many stores have plenty of clerks and some window shoppers but few actual buyers.Liang Tonghui, a 40-year-old from central China\u2019s Henan province, stood recently at a nearly deserted fruit stand in Beijing, trying to sell peaches and apples. Almost all the other migrants he knows are struggling to find work. He sells apples for 40% off at the end of each day because he cannot find full-price buyers.\u201cIf half the people are not coming to work,\u201d Liang said, \u201cwhat do you think is the number of people coming here?\u201dChina needs to kick-start consumption because the old ways to juice its economy don\u2019t work like they once did. After running up huge debts to pay for new high-speed rail lines, highways and other infrastructure following the global financial crisis, China tried to depend more on its consumers. In an economy that registered nearly a half-century of continuous growth without recording a single recession, young people in particular became willing to borrow and spend almost like Americans.A number of economists have called on China to do more to help consumers. While the United States and other countries have unleashed major spending programs that include direct payments to households, China has largely refrained so far, in part because of debt concerns.Without shoppers, the retail industry \u2014 one of the largest employers in China \u2014 will continue to suffer.Peng Fei lost his part-time job at a clothing store in south-central China that closed during the pandemic. He has responded by halting trips to the gym and cut back on going drinking with friends. He has shelved plans to move out of his parents\u2019 home.\u201cBefore, I\u2019d spend as much as I had,\u201d he said.The shock of the virus and accompanying lockdowns have also prompted many to review their spending priorities.Harry Guo, a 22-year-old Shanghai bartender, said that he used to spend any extra money he had on vacations to other cities in China but had been stunned by how many people had trouble affording even groceries during the pandemic. Now he does not worry about keeping up appearances when he goes out, seldom buying new sneakers or other indulgences.\u201cAs long as the money is in your wallet, there is a strong sense of security,\u201d Guo said. \u201cIt just has to lie there, you don\u2019t have to spend it, you feel comfortable just opening the wallet and seeing it.\u201dTo qualify for extra loans from banks or rent waivers from landlords, businesses have typically been required to avoid layoffs. Many companies reduced hours and pay instead.Chen Ke works for a Shanghai sports events planner and saw his pay drop by four-fifths last month as events were canceled. He has started working part time as a food delivery driver and has given up restaurant meals in favor of instant noodles and pasta at home. He now makes coffee from instant powder instead of buying freshly brewed cups at his local convenience store.\u201cThe salary used to be put into your bank account every day; it was just a number,\u201d Chen said. But delivering food for less than a dollar per trip, \u201cI really understand how hard it is to make money.\u201dThe risk for China is that its consumers grow too cautious in their spending. The country has spent years enlarging its social safety net to extend health care and other services to more people so that they will spend their money instead of saving it for an emergency.As a 29-year-old who could always find work, Cao, the Beijing translator, never worried about where her next paycheck might come from. She accumulated a closet full of expensive handbags.Amid the epidemic, one day she pulled out all of her handbags, spread them on her bed and examined them with dissatisfaction.\u201cI spent so much money to buy handbags,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cHow can these handbags help me now?\u201dIt is still not clear whether the new consumer frugality in China will last beyond the broad availability of a vaccine and the resumption of normal life. But for now, many are saying that their attitudes have changed for good.\u201cWhat if I get a serious illness in the future; what if I lost my job again in the future?\u201d Cao said. \u201cI think that in the future, I must have a certain amount of money in my bank account to make me feel secure.\u201d\u00a0"], "tags": "#Business#China#Economy#Health#Lifestyle#news service#Science & technology#World News"},

We will see far greater participation from women, who chose to stay at home, and it will add to the productive workforce.A corporate leader said he is seeing the beginning of a fourth industrial revolution and added that India should strive to get a proper share of the pie.Secretary General of industry body ASSOCHAM, Deepak Sood, said there is a broader consensus that the global manufacturing supply chain would be more spread than concentrated in major economies like China.\"If India comes out of the present crisis with minimum of impact, we can be the destination of choice for the global manufacturing giants in different sectors like electronics, computer hardware, pharmaceuticals, including medical devices, automobile, including components and other engineering products,\" he told PTI.Another industrialist said India really needs to open up and welcome whoever wants to diversify and bring manufacturing into India.\"Manufacturing is very, very necessary. At the end of the day we have really skipped that and gone into services. But manufacturing is very important and we need to be able to capture this moment when a lot of manufacturing could come to India if we show the right policies, set up single window clearances and hand-hold companies coming in,\" the industrialist, who did not wish to be named, said.Sood said crude prices are expected to stay muted at least for the medium term, adding that with India depending 80 percent on imported crude,low prices would be a big advantage for the economy with a multiplier impact on consumer demand.The other major advantage for India, relative to other major economies, is that the country depends on domestic consumption, absorbing a large part of our output, he said.Though exports are important for meeting foreign exchange requirements, the global markets are likely to remain subdued for longer period. But post COVID-19, our domestic consumption is expected to bounce back sooner than exports, he said.A top executive of a company said the Fourth industrial revolution is on us. We no longer have to sort of ask as to when it will come, it's here on us, he said.Asked if he expects India to drive the fourth industrial revolution, he said the country does have the talent and depth of technology to be able to do quite a bit.India can definitely look toward diversification of supply chains.The wisdom of Indians should ensure that proper share comes to India. We have the people, the demographics, ability to skill our people very, very quickly. We have democracy,we have lot of things going for us , he said.But we have to make it count for us, instead of squabbling and wasting time; we really need to get our act together to be able to welcome whichever industry that wants to diversify its supply chains , he added.An industry executive said there would be far more focus on expanding social infrastructure going forward and fields such as biotechnology and biochemistry would get a boost, while online content writers would be very much in demand.Digital platforms are allowing customising teaching for individuals and education would become much more personalised, he said.Delivery will cease to be single channel or dual channel and it would all become omni channel .An operator in the MSME sector said the government's top priority post-COVID-19 should continue to be the health of the people and to feed the masses. These two will have to be top priority for a while till such time a medicine or vaccine is discovered, he said.Sood said thankfully, India's agriculture and rural economy have so far remained least affected by the pandemic. Foodgrains in the Central pool are three-times the buffer requirements even before arrival of the new crop in mandis. So the Centre and states would continue to have enough elbow room for looking after the vulnerable sections of society, he said.On what should be the Government's priority post-COVID 19, Sood said: \"Ensure continuous and enough liquidity both for the consumers and producers of goods and services. Retain lower interest rate regime, stay nimble and act quickly as and when a sector starts showing any stress.\"He said that hospitality, transport, airlines and exports are being crushed the most by the health crisis, and these sectors would need special revival packages in the form of interest subvention, subsidy for repairing the impaired assets, reduction in taxes, including GST and other levies.He said the public expenditure on the healthcare sector should be at least doubled and eventually reach five per cent of the GDP from less than 1.5 percent at present.The public-private partnership should be encouraged, not only in the area of front-end healthcare, but also in the R&D and development of cutting edge drugs and vaccines, he said."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#India#Indian industry"},

And it was the sharpest fall since the economy shrank at an 8.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the depths of the Great Recession.Forecasters say the drop in the January-March quarter will be only a precursor of a far grimmer GDP report to come on the current April-June period, with business shutdowns and layoffs striking with devastating force. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that GDP will plunge this quarter at a 40 percent annual rate.That would be, by a breathtaking margin, the bleakest quarter since such records were first compiled in 1947. It would be four times the size of the worst quarterly contraction on record set in 1958.In just a few weeks, businesses across the country have shut down and laid off tens of millions of workers. Factories and stores are shuttered. Home sales are falling. Households are slashing spending. Consumer confidence is sinking.As the economy slides into what looks like a severe recession, some economists are holding out hope that a recovery will arrive quickly and robustly once the health crisis has been solved \u2014 what some call a V-shaped recovery. Increasingly, though, analysts say they think the economy will struggle to regain its momentum even after the viral outbreak has subsided.Many Americans, they suggest, could remain too fearful to travel, shop at stores or visit restaurants or movie theaters anywhere near as much as they used to.In addition, local and state officials may continue to limit, for health reasons, how many people may congregate in such places at any one time, thereby making it difficult for many businesses to survive.

The insurance company will take a decision to extend the cover on a case-to-case basis.For those with sum insured of Rs 5 crore, the extension will be given for the retail and SME sector automatically.But even here, there is a pre-condition that the insured company has to take all safety precautions including fire and smoke detection, burglary protection, among others.Generally, while business interruption due to fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters are covered, COVID-19 has been specifically excluded. This means that companies will lose several crores in finances, which would have been otherwise covered in a non-pandemic scenario.In a series of communications sent to individual business owners, non-life insurers have clarified that business interruption cover is not operative during the period of non-occupancy.

The partnership between two of the most iconic symbols of entrepreneurship in the world\u2019s largest democracies makes more than just business sense\u2014its strategic value will not be lost on those at the highest levels of the government for whom India\u2019s security is the top priority. Particularly now, when, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic which originated in China, world powers are beginning to reassess their relationship with the Middle Kingdom.India, for whom China is an immediate neighbour with a long and disputed border, managing the relationship has been a tricky balancing act. India has expanded the trade and economic relationship significantly in the hope that the renminbi and the rupee will provide the glue that binds. While India\u2019s motives have been good, the outcomes have been far from satisfactory--China takes way more than it gives, continues to act against Indian interests (especially in relation to Pakistan) and mistrust continues as before.The trade deficit with China in 2019 was nearly $57 billion while Indian companies exported items worth less than $18 billion. India\u2019s top software companies have continued to complain of market-access issues in China, which is adept at erecting non-tariff barriers. On the other hand, Chinese companies, especially in digital, have the run of the place in India. PUBG, a gaming app owned by Tencent, is among the highest-grossing apps in the country. TikTok is among the most downloaded. Helo, Clash of Clans, UC Browser, ShareIt, you name it, all fly the red-and-yellow flag.Meanwhile, the likes of TCS, Infosys and Wipro are crying their throats hoarse about market access problems in China. Ditto for the pharmaceutical companies or exporters of agri products. Registering a business can take years, and inspections are expensive and onerous. State-owned companies are preferred and the system is non-transparent and complicated. When the Chinese do business, you can never be clear where business ends and politics begins and how much of business is cover for espionage.It is the habit of obfuscation and hyper-nationalism that has caused the world to react with horror to the manner in which China has handled the coronavirus crisis. It has sought to blame other countries for its acts of omission and commission and is adding insult to injury by seeking to buy up quality assets whose prices have been beaten down because of a virus incubated in China.As the world reassesses its relationship with an undemocratic country which has been inimical to India since independence, we should carefully consider the impact of Chinese presence in areas vital to our national interest. Sector such as telecommunications, social media, payments and indeed all digital interactions\u2014areas in which Jio specialises--are not just engines of commerce. They are intimately bound up with national security\u2014to listen to what Indians are saying to each other and to have the power to manipulate our online interactions is not a power that the Chinese should have over us. We definitely have no such privileges in China.Jio, which has demonstrated a master-class in building a world-class digital platform, is a symbol of Indian ingenuity. It is a true-blue example of home-grown entrepreneurship, acquiring nearly 400 million users in 42 months and unleashing a data revolution in India.

The last month and more has spelt despair for the helps who don't know when the lockdown will end and whether they can get back to work even when it does.Sushila Kaushalya Devi, who lives in Madanpur Khadar, nearly 12 km from her area of work in south Delhi's C R Park, said one of her three employers preempted the lockdown (announced on March 24) and gave her an advance to stock up on rations.This would have been okay for the month for her family of four \u2013 including her husband and two children -- had it not been for the suddenness of the announcement due to which her brother-in-law's two children, who were visiting at the time, are still with her.\u201cThe food which would have lasted the four of us an entire month got over several days ago and there's no money to buy more,\u201d she said, adding that she has been unable to collect her salary from the other two employers due to the restrictions on movement.The money can't be transferred to a bank account because she doesn't have an ATM card and the bank is too far.Married to a vertically challenged man who she said is \u201cconstantly refused work\u201d, Sushila is the sole earning member of the family and struggling to make ends meet with no money coming in for at least another month.There are about 10-15 lakh women like Sushila in the Delhi-NCR region alone, estimates Maya John of the Gharelu Kamgar Union (GKU) that works with domestic helpers in Gurgaon, Noida, and parts of Rohini in Delhi.\u201cSince there are no official figures documenting the number of people working in this sector, the actual number is likely to be as high as 10-15 lakh,\u201d John told PTI.She said only a few workers were fortunate to receive an advance salary, have access to virtual payment options such as bank transfers, PayTM and Google-Pay, or able to collect their dues from the houses they work in.Their problems are many, including being harassed by police on the way and lack of public transport. For many, their pre-paid sim cards have run out of money and they have no way of recharging their phones.Many employers said they were unable to contact their domestic helpers over the phone.\u201cFirst they face harassment by the police on the way. Even if somehow, through internal lanes and streets, these maids do manage to reach the housing complexes where they work, there is friction with the RWAs. Many are not letting them even collect their salaries,\u201d John said.\u201cWe have been getting in touch with these RWAs and requesting them to provide \u2018confidence building measures' to the workers in these difficult times, by allowing the employers to pay them,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0she added.Several employers have also said they would not pay wages if the maids don't turn up for work.Pinky, who works as a cleaning and cooking help in Noida's Sector 39, has been trying to go and collect her salary from her employers since the first week of April but in vain.\u201cEvery time I step out, police stops me at the barricades,\u201d she said.With her husband, a construction worker, also out of work, the couple has been forced to dig into their nominal savings for day-to-day survival.\u201cWe were repaying the loan we took for our elder daughter's wedding two years back with whatever money we managed to save. Now we have to depend on that to feed ourselves and the debt is just increasing.\u201cIt will be difficult for us to survive another month,\u201d the mother of three said, hoping that the lockdown will be lifted on May 3.Like Sushila, Pinky too does not have access to an ATM card and is waiting for the restrictions to be relaxed so she can collect her salary.Aditi Yajnik from SEWA, which has been providing relief to the families of domestic workers in different parts of Delhi during the lockdown, said many of the women are migrants and don't have ration cards, or even jan-dhan accounts.While the Delhi government is trying to provide rations to as many people as possible under its Temporary Ration Coupon Service, Yajnik said the e-coupon process is \u201cpainfully slow\u201d.To get rations under the scheme, applicants needs to generate an e-coupon through the government's official website using their mobile number and Aadhar Card number.\u201cMost of these people are illiterate, and surfing through a website to download a coupon is not possible for everyone,\u201d she pointed out.Yajnik also noted that while food was most essential to survival, there were other needs like access to medicines, baby food, phone recharges and basic toiletries that must be taken care of.She cited the example of a five-month pregnant domestic worker who does not have enough money to buy medicines for herself.\u201cShe already has three kids and is pregnant with the fourth. The husband worked as a construction labourer, and is out of a job too. There is no money in the family.

It is predatory because Chinese Inc showed a strong appetite for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and in recent years, they have been indiscriminatingly binging on takeovers despite unforeseen results.The Chinese are on top of the list as not only India but Anglo-American, European models have been defused by the new Chinese interventions, which are more disruptive than adventure if one can call so. On the one hand, when the status of Chinese public sector investments is under scrutiny internationally, private players are eying for a more market rhythm in the time of financial distress.Such an endgame in the form of M&A always existed. However, China\u2019s imperceptive use let the M&A to acquire not only a fancy name of takeover diplomacy but a reputation of disruptors.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese outbound M&A recorded a steady growth of $59.6bn via 946 deals in Q1 2020. This is not at an average score compared to several deals and the total investment figures. Some of the M&A activities in past three weeks show the consistency at which Chinese companies made headways in Australia, the United States, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Russia, Holland, including some usual suspects around such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and others from South East Asia, to name a few.All these economies have taken a hit by the pandemic and are heading towards a definite recession. The fears of market volatility or low asset prices, allowing Chinese entities opportunities to take over loom over major economies globally. Consequently, Chinese buyers are facing increasing troubles as protectionism in various investee countries are devising their own set of safety measures.From the early 2000s, Chinese companies, in a new spin on globalising footprint, looked at M&A as a springboard. The Chinese were big domestically, but being big in China is one thing; being big globally was another.A focused strategy to shape global M&A was seen effective in raising the Chinese global standing dramatically. Chinese were attempting every bid to flex their deal-making muscles, especially when the supply of bankrupt companies rose sharply during the global financial crisis of 2007. From Italian home d\u00e9cor brands to French couture names, deep inside Europe from chocolates to hotels, Chinese went on an overtaking spree. Technology, R&D labs, startups, and many industries that were losing business were quick to find the Chinese buyers. The financial distress and market volatilities turned into perfect opportunities over financial soundness, and good credit standing of global enterprises.It is not often that loss-making companies are the enticing acquisition targets, but the Chinese do see benefits beyond books. Especially while entering into a new market and new industries, enterprises often experience a lack of resources and capacity to pursue diversification strategies and engage in activities in different areas. Through M&A and related strategic alliances, enterprises can borrow external resources and capabilities for their use; they quickly open up new markets or enter new industries.Just for reference, Chinese Haier decided to acquire Japan\u2019s Sanyo Electric, a company that had been in the red since 2005 when Haier was reigning domestic appliances market and growth abroad looked difficult. After the July 2011 acquisition, the Chinese brand exploited the opportunities not only in Japan, but also in Asia-pacific. For the first time, a Chinese company had acquired the main business of a large Japanese company, and Sanyo had particular popularity in the Southeast Asian market, and Haier could use the Sanyo brand to expand its business in the Southeast Asian market.In recent times, Chinese companies have been trying to influence not only the production chains but also the value and supply chains to stand out in the global market, and be at the top of the food chain. Any acquisition by the foreign player in India has strategic influence. The M&A in the technology-related services sector would offer the investor global prospects, and, in the productions, it will provide them a plum domestic market to expand.Since most of the M&A has been done with a strategic mind than the business acumen or excellent commercial investment, they have perished over the period resulting in a limited success rate. According to statistics from McKinsey, in the past 20 years, the success rate of Chinese companies\u2019 overseas M&A did not exceed 33 percent. However, this does not dampen the efforts of Chinese enterprises to snap up global brands hit by the downturn and are available at lower prices as forecasts indicate Chinese outbound M&A will continue apace."], "tags": "#China#Covid-19#Economy#FDI policy#global financial crisis#mergers and acquisitions#recession#takeovers#trade"},

"], "time": ["Last Updated : Apr 28, 2020 02:28 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["Moneycontrol.com"], "article": ["As the COVID-19 outbreak wreaked havoc on the economy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) responded quickly to make sufficient liquidity available for banks to lend to targeted segments. Since its first intervention, the central bank has repeatedly assured markets about its readiness to step in at any point when system is short of liquidity.But despite the central bank's alacrity, NBFCs and smaller companies are getting the rough end of the stick.When the RBI made regulations stringent in its second round of targeted long-term repo operation 2.0 (TLTRO 2.0) by making it mandatory for banks to lend half of the money availed to small NBFCs and MFIs, banks played a trick.In the TLTRO 2.0 auction, bids worth only Rs 12,850 crore were received against the Rs 25,000 crore funds offered at the auction. Banks simply didn't want to avail this money and lend to small firms. Reason: fear of future bad loans. Just like TLTRO, the RBI's liquidity window for mutual funds to the tune of Rs50,000 crores too may not\u00a0 have much demand.\"I don't see them taking lower rated corporate debt as collateral, which has been lacking in liquidity. So if we see heavy redemption in schemes which carry large exposure to lower rated corporate debt, liquidity will remain a problem,\" said Arvind Chari, Head - Fixed Income & Alternatives, Quantum Advisors.Announcing the special liquidity facility, the RBI said under this window, the RBI will conduct repo operations of 90 days tenor at the fixed repo rate of 4.4 percent. Funds availed under this window can be used by banks exclusively for meeting the liquidity requirements of MFs by extending loans, and undertaking outright purchase of investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial papers , debentures and certificates of deposit held by MFs, RBI said.Under TLTRO, banks can borrow at 4.4 percent from the RBI and lend at 2-2.5 percent margin. Still, banks may not be too keen to lend against lower rated papers on account of the risks involved, industry officials said.\"Remember if the banks had this appetite, they could have used the LTRO money and bought these lower rated bonds from mutual funds in the secondary market,\" said Chari of Quantum Advisors.According to Kumaresh Ramakrishnan, CIO, Fixed Income, PGIM India Mutual Fund, banks are in a wait-and-watch mode.\"We have to see how the response for this round. My sense is that banks will find this window attractive because of the arbitrage and given the fact that many good quality AA papers are in the market,\" he said.Banks, in fact, have a\u00a0\u00a0decent business in RBI's TLTRO window. They get money at repo rate, 4.4 percent and can lend to companies at a rate 6.5 percent to 10 percent (for top rated firms). But, banks fear is that once the Covid-19 lock-down and moratorium is over, they will get stuck with these bad quality companies. Their lending decisions can get questioned at that time. Banks don\u2019t want to take that risk.Rating agencies too highlight banks' risk aversion. According to rating agency, Icra, with excess liquidity of around Rs 4.85 trillion as on April 24, 2020, banks however continue to remain largely risk averse.\"We expect the liquidity of the higher rated papers to improve on the back of this facility. Accordingly, active participation from the banks will be key to the success of this scheme,\" Icra said.Low-rated papers don't have much demand in the market, a major reason why Franklin Templeton had to close six debt schemes. The credit risk funds had high exposure to below AA-rated funds. Over the past one year, these funds have witnessed immense redemption pressure.Their risk aversion has affected NBFCs and smaller MFIs the most. Smaller NBFCs and MFIs have been deal a double whammy because these firms had to give moratorium to their borrowers but didn't get the same treatment from their lenders. NBFCs borrow from banks and raise money from money markets. With banks refusing moratorium and RBI\u2019s liquidity support not reaching them, NBFCs and MFIs have found themselves in a tough spot.Even the refinance window announced by the RBI for an amount of Rs 50,000 crore is not benefiting small NBFCs and MFIs on account of the stringent conditions. SIDBI, which has launched a scheme after availing Rs 15,000 crore from RBI under special liquidity support,\u00a0 wants MFIs to pay back money in 90 days. This, along with the condition of minimum \u2013BBB rating, has made refinance scheme practically of little help for smaller companies.\"Ultimately, it is not the liquidity but fear among banks about future defaults that have made RBI\u2019s liquidity schemes inaccessible for small companies,\" said an analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage.Bankers say if the government guarantees risks on bank lending to small companies, the problem of risk aversion will be addressed. , the Modi government is considering a proposal to guarantee as much as Rs 3 lakh crore of bank loans to small businesses, as part of a plan to restart the economy. This, bankers feel, can give lot of comfort to banks to lend to small firms."], "tags": "#Banks#coronavirus#Economy#RBI#TLTRO"},

While no data was stolen, this company\u2019s client base of more than 10 entities sought a complete external audit of this incident by independent consultants including the list of participants and their background, possible data leaks and private information theft.Considering the amount of information to be assessed, a cost of almost Rs 40 lakh cost was incurred by the company. While this firm\u2019s cyber cover would pay for this cost, the company is looking to hike the size of the policy.Amidst the  (COVID-19) outbreak, companies in India are having a re-look at cyber insurance covers to look into what their risks and liabilities could be. Here, the potential situations and cost estimates are being analysed to arrive at appropriate insurance covers.COVID-19 has led to employees across companies working from home. With this, all client meetings, audit meetings as well as confidential board meetings are held virtually. This opens up corporates to potential threats of breach, phishing and ransomware.In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Anup Dhingra, MD - FINPRO (Financial and Professional Liability) & Private Equity M&A Leader of insurance broking firm Marsh India said that a lot of companies are looking at taking higher covers to match their liabilities.\u201cApart from liabilities related to COVID-19, exchange rate fluctuations are also forcing companies to increase the cover size. This is because the insurance is pegged to the dollar rate,\u201d he added.Each company has to disclose as part of its customer contracts the amount of insurance cover taken for segments like cyber. Due to rupee depreciation, there have been cases where due to rupee value declining versus the US dollar, these companies been found to not adhere to the earlier disclosed limits. This makes it essential that they buy additional limits on the cyber cover.In India, less than 1,000 cyber insurance policies have been issued so far. The cover differs depending on the industry and individual companies. On average, for $1 million covers, the premium could range from $6,000-11,000.Sectors like banking and financial services, IT/ITeS and e-commerce with a high focus on retail customers are considered to be at higher risk as far as cyber liability is concerned. Higher the limit, lower could be the premium share.Dhingra said that apart from the traditional industries mentioned above, sectors alike pharmaceuticals, oil refinery, energy and power sectors are taking steps to ramp up their cyber insurance covers.He explained that the cover offers protection against liabilities related to ransomware, breach response and phishing incidents among others.\u201cCompanies have realised that cyber is the number one risk at this point. Even if there is no direct data loss, there could be other costs related to audits or help taken from external consultants in case of a breach,\u201d he added.Apart from breach incidents, ransomware attacks have become common ever since the lockdown due to COVID-19 was announced. Here, an attacker threatens to publish private data or block access to confidential information unless a ransom is paid.Mid-to-large size companies take between $10 million to 350 million of limits in the cyber insurance covers.This ransom could be instruments like bitcoins where negotiations are done with the criminals to retrieve the data. Insurance would pay for these costs.When an Indian corporate\u2019s global client had a breach event, the biggest worry was whether there would be any loss of data. While there was no data theft or breach the global client billed $1 million to this Indian company for seeking the help of an external consultant. The cyber cover paid for these losses.The Marsh Microsoft 2019 Global Cyber Risk Perception Survey showed that 79 percent of respondents ranked cyber risk among the top five concerns for their organization, up from 62 percent in 2017. This survey report also said cyber risk has moved beyond data breaches and privacy concerns to sophisticated schemes that can disrupt entire businesses, industries, supply chains, and nations, costing the economy billions of dollars and affecting companies in every sector."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#insurance"},

Auto firms such as SAIC's MG Motor and Great Wall, and investors Alibaba and Tencent have placed major bets on India.The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi has called the new screening policy discriminatory.A senior Indian government source who is involved in policy making told Reuters that New Delhi will try to approve any investment proposal in a non-sensitive sector within 15 days when the stake being bought is not significant.The official declined to elaborate on which sectors would be considered sensitive and what threshold of investment would be deemed significant.\"We will try to fast track investment proposals as soon as possible. It may be faster for some (sectors) and in others we might take some time,\" said the official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions.Two other sources familiar with the government's thinking confirmed that a fast track mechanism was being considered, with possible approval timelines of seven days to four weeks.India's ministry of commerce and industry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While the fast track mechanism would be open to all India's neighbours with a land border, China would be the main beneficiary. Unlike Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, it has major existing and planned investments in India, which the Brookings research group estimated at $26 billion.Dipti Lavya Swain, a partner at Indian law firm HSA Advocates which advises Chinese companies, said sectors such as telecoms, financial services and insurance were likely to be deemed more sensitive than others such as automobiles and renewable energy.\"Approvals should be a seamless process and anything between two to four weeks could still be bearable,\" Swain said. \"Sectors which are already under severe financial distress and do not concern national security should also receive faster approvals.\"The new Indian screening rules are designed to prevent fire sales of corporate assets during the coronavirus outbreak but government sources have said they will also apply to greenfield investments, as well as investments from Hong Kong.Responding to Reuters questions this week, China's foreign ministry said it hoped for a better business environment as India had set up more barriers for some investors.\"China is concerned.

The strict measures in place have caused extreme economic crises, including huge job losses, and business closures.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are 4,220 COVID-19 infections in the country with 79 deaths.From May 1, the lockdown will move to level 4 where some businesses will be allowed to resume operations under strict conditions.Borders will still remain closed and only travel to repatriate South African citizens from abroad or take foreigners in South Africa back to their home countries will be permitted.At level 3, there will be restrictions on many activities, including at workplaces and social gatherings to address the high risk of transmission.Level 2 will allow some leisure and social activities with stringent physical distancing and other requirements to prevent a resurgence of the virus.Under level 1, normal activity can resume with precautions and health guidelines followed at all times.Giving details of the five-phase approach on Thursday, Ramaphosa said that the threat level will be distinguished at the national, provincial, district and metropolitan level.\u201cThe National Coronavirus Command Council will determine the alert level based on an assessment of the infection rate and the capacity of our health system to provide care to those who need it,\" he said.The president said that after April 30, the country will implement a risk adjusted strategy to take a deliberate and cautious approach to ease the lockdown restrictions.\u201cThe strategy we take now must be measured and incremental. We cannot take action today that we deeply regret tomorrow.\u201cWe have to balance the need to resume economic activity with the need to save lives,\" he said.\u201cWhile a nationwide lockdown is probably the best means to contain the virus, it cannot be sustained indefinitely. Our people need to eat. They need to earn a living. Companies need to generate revenue,\u201d the president said.The president said that the lockdown gave them the time to prepare health facilities and mobilise some of the essential medical supplies needed to meet the increase in infections.\"And it is in doing so, that we hope to save tens of thousands of lives,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\u201cThere is clear evidence that the lockdown has been working.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, this rises to more than 90 percent.Among the measures that have been taken, Slovenia has introduced a temporary basic income, India has launched direct cash benefit transfers and Brazil's government is doing similar.\"It is a really hard trade-off,\" said Monica de Bolle at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advises Brazil's government.De Bolle calculates that support programmes in Brazil and Mexico providing the vulnerable with half the minimum wage for one year would add up to some 7 percentage points of GDP.\"In many countries a very large share of the population... are in informal labour markets - even if you provide relatively low stipends, you are still talking about 5-10 percentage points of GDP - that is huge when everything is already stretched thin.\"The number of extra deaths from COVID-19 compared to a country's overall death rate varies hugely.Calculating on the basis that 20 percent of the population will get infected of which 6.6 percent will lose their lives, the total numbers add up to a different proportion of total annual deaths in each country, said Charles Robertson at Renaissance Capital.\"The human cost is very different, and the total human cost as a proportion of the population should be very much less in young African countries than in older European countries, and that then is going to impact on government thinking about the right economic policy response,\" said Robertson.Some countries with low numbers of extra deaths measured in additional weeks of annual deaths have been quick to come out of lockdown. Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo lifted restrictions after just three weeks in its two main cities, citing a push to \"protect the economy\".Lockdowns are choking private consumption, which plays a key role in many emerging market economies and, in some, are a main driver of growth.Private consumption accounted for more than 80 percent of GDP in 2019 in Egypt, around 77 percent in Kenya and Ghana and more than 60 percent in South Africa.\"Consumer spending will be the channel where we will see the most immediate and visible fallout,\" said Jacques Nel, head of Africa macro at NKC Research.\"Rising consumer spending has been a big driver behind growth in many countries, especially in West and East Africa, but we also have to keep in mind that consumer spending plays a big role in the larger economies overall,\" he added."], "tags": "#Brazil#Business#coronavirus#Economy#Egypt#Ghana#India#International Labour Office#Kenya#Mexico#South Africa#World News"},

He just spent Rs 2 lakh (as annual premium) in March 2020 buying a 'savings plan' from an insurance company. Turns out he will end up paying almost Rs 12 lakh as premium for this policy to get benefits only 15 years later.\"I was told that I would be able to get double the money as returns but I wasn't aware that the benefits would be paid out only after 15 years. Now since I have paid one premium, I would need to continue it for four more years before surrendering this product. I could have used this money for some other purpose,\" he said.Madhavan was sold this investment/savings product by a 'friendly' agent who should have sold a more appropriate product for this age group.One glance at the life insurance premium collection data for FY20 will show you that the actual yearly increase in number of policies sold to individuals is negligible.IRDAI data shows that private life insurers saw a 4 percent year-on-year (YoY) drop in the number of policies sold even as new premiums rose by 11.7 percent YoY. This is an indication that it is merely the ticket size of insurance products that is increasing and new policies sold remain similar to previous years.The worst is policies with high ticket-sizes being sold to those above 65 years of age. On one hand, these individuals do not understand the policy tenure while on the other, they end up paying a very high premium which is difficult to sustain over a long term.Mumbai's 74-year-old Kavita Sable had to miss paying the Rs 3 lakh insurance premium for a savings plan she bought two years ago from a private life insurer because she could not arrange for cash by redeeming other investments.\"I was not able to transfer cash from other investments like mutual funds to pay this premium. My friends now tell me that I made a mistake by buying a 10 year tenure product at this age with such high annual premiums,\" she added.Most of these policies are sold by agents who end up earning a fat commission by selling these products. Higher the premium and policy tenure, more is the commission paid. The ones who lose are the senior citizen policyholders.Surrendering a policy prematurely means that a significant portion of the premium paid is lost and only minimum benefit is received. Even if the paid-up value is built after three years of premium payment, this is lower than the actual money paid during this period. A better idea would be to put this money in a fixed liquid instrument with a minimum but guaranteed return.For senior citizens, liquid assets are crucial considering their age and the allied health issues. Delhi's 67-year-old Anita Bhalla learnt it the hard way.Bhalla's agent told her that she could withdraw the money from her policy whenever she wanted while earning returns continuously. She paid Rs 2.8 lakh as premium for a 15-year insurance policy and is now stuck without cash amidst a medical emergency.\"I was hospitalised and urgently needed cash for the treatment. I thought I could cancel the policy and pay the charges. But I realised that since only one year has been completed in the policy, I would end up losing the entire amount if I let it lapse. I made a mistake by buying it,\" she added.While buyers might exercise caution and not choose insurance products with very high premium and policy term if they are above 65 years unless the individual belongs to the higher-income category. Individual customers need to evaluate if they indeed have the risk appetite at 65 years to buy a policy and pay high premiums for the next 15-20 years.But the real onus is on the insurance company and its distributors (like agents and banks). While an insurer and its distributor may end up collecting hefty premiums by selling such policies, it comes at a cost of persistency drop or low renewals."], "tags": "#Business#Economy#insurance"},

It is abundantly clear that there will have to be a massive economic relief \u2014 both fiscal and monetary \u2014 to bring the economy back to normalcy.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already taken several actions using all its instruments of monetary policy. It has injected enormous amount of liquidity into the banking system, significantly reduced policy interest rates and given relief to debtors through moratorium on repayment. In addition to providing monetary stimulus, the RBI also has to deal with financial instability arising from the pandemic.Already, despite creating oceans of liquidity through actions, large parts of the financial system, especially non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are struggling to get liquidity. The RBI has used monetary policy tool (LTRO) to direct credit to these liquidity-starved sectors.By now, it is clear that these monetary actions by the RBI will not be enough. It will have to be matched with a sizeable fiscal relief. Governments (both central and states) will have to spend to get the economy back to normalcy.Fiscal consolidation has been a priority of the Indian economic management for a long time. This year\u2019s (FY21) Budget had projected the fiscal deficit of the central government at 3.5 percent of the GDP.\u00a0 Clearly, this target will be missed by a large margin. The lockdown and the disruption to the economy will reduce revenue for the economy and there will have to significant additional spending.Need for large government spending to stimulate the economy is raising important questions about financing the deficit. What are the sources that the government will have to tap to support the relief package? How much monetization will have to be undertaken? Will there be an increase in taxes? And so on.In order to understand the challenges the government will face in financing this large deficit and the choices it has, we have to understand the issue systematically.There are four important questions that will decide the structure and magnitude of the relief package and it is financing:4. What implications will the pattern of funding have on key economic variables such as GDP growth rate, inflation, interest rates, financial stability, etc.?Following these questions, we can speculate about that the broad contours of a likely relief package. It is obvious that the bulk of the relief will be focused on the most vulnerable part of the economy \u2014 supporting consumption for the poorest sections of the population and to provide relief for the micro, small and medium enterprise.For the poor, the support may take a form of direct cash transfers into the accounts of beneficiaries on similar lines of the program launched for distressed farmers some time ago. In addition to such transfers, there may also be subsidies on essential consumption goods. For the MSME, relief could come in the form of debt waivers for very small businesses. For example, the Mudra loan borrowers would all suffer greatly through the pandemic and hence, there could be a partial or total debt waiver for them.\u00a0 There could also be longer moratoriums and some interest waivers on other MSME borrowing.Large companies may not get direct debt relief but they could also get longer debt moratoriums. The government could create a credit enhancement or guarantee program that would encourage the banks which are gripped with extreme risk aversion, to start lending to these companies again. There could also be a facility sponsored by the government to provide finance directly to companies that are struggling to raise it due to the pandemic.The extent of support needed could only be decided when the pandemic is under control and the lockdown is eased. Currently, there is no clarity on the extent of support needed and hence the size of the relief package cannot be determined. All we can say at this stage is that the likely size of the package could be as high as 4 percent to 5 percent of the GDP.7. Monetizing the deficit \u2014 borrowing from the RBI directly.Each of these sources would bring in financing over varying quantum and over varying time horizons. As a result, overall financing scheme for the relief package is likely to include all these sources.6. Credit defaults will rise, and along with rising interest rates, will continue to pose a challenge to financial stability. Deposit growth will slow down and household savings will decline. NBFCs, especially small and mid-sized will continue to face funding challenge. Some of them will face acute solvency challenge due to borrower defaults and funding squeeze. Rising defaults could result in capital erosion in the banking system and the government as owner of two thirds of the banking system will have to face new demands of bank capitalization.The government essentially faces a set of difficult choices. While it must provide a large fiscal relief to support the economy, such a package will have negative implications for interest rates, inflation and financial stability.It will also be critical for the fiscal and monetary policy to work in very close coordination so that fiscal and monetary actions are chosen and sequenced thoughtfully. Only monetary action will not be enough and fiscal relief without careful thinking on its monetary implications may actually add to the economic challenge.Just as the best way of dealing with the health challenge of the novel coronavirus is acting together as a community, so it will be for dealing with the economic challenge arising from it."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#India#RBI"},

Therefore, the full magnitude of the economic impact of COVID-19 will only be clear only over a course of time,\" the statement said.Among the suggestions made to the commission, the council members said small scale enterprises were cash-starved even prior to the onset of the pandemic.\"As their activity levels and cash flows are affected, it is important that a support mechanism be devised to help them overcome this problem,\" it said.Also, non-banking financial companies are affected by the slowdown and in order to avoid bankruptcies and deepening of NPAs in the financial sector, measures should be appropriately designed.Measures like partial loan guarantee may help. The Reserve Bank of India will have a key role in ensuring that financial institutions are well-capitalised, the council members suggested.Also the finances of the central and state governments need to be watched carefully in the wake of increased spending to fight the pandemic.\"As we move ahead, we need to think of options for financing the additional deficit. It is important to ensure that the State governments get access to adequate funds to undertake their fight against the pandemic,\" it added.Besides the healthcare cost, the government is also faced with the additional burden of giving booster or stimulus to sectors and industries hit by the nationwide lockdown.The lockdown that began on March 25 was last week extended till May 3. Late last month, the government had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash dole to poor women and elderly.A second package, aimed at industries, is said to be in the works and will likely be announced shortly.Several international agencies including IMF and the World Bank have cut India's growth forecast over concerns about the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed India's GDP growth projection to 1.9 percent in 2020 from 5.8 percent estimated in January, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s due to the raging coronavirus pandemic.Similarly, the World Bank has estimated India's economy to grow between 1.5 to 2.8 percent in the 2020-21 -- the worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation.Fitch has projected India's GDP to grow at 0.8 percent this fiscal, while S&P pegs it at 1.8 percent and Moody's at 2.5 percent in 2020.These growth estimates compare to an estimated 5 percent growth rate in 2019-20 fiscal that ended on March 31. India's economy also grew by 5 percent in 2019 calendar year.The council also felt that it is likely that different states may come out of the severity of the impact of the pandemic in different stages.

Responding to the market situation, Governor Shaktikanta Das announced back-to-back measures to help the banks, non-banks and now MFs in the backdrop of the tough market conditions. The RBI has actively engaged with markets to ensure liquidity in the market to nullify the impact of COVID-19 crisis.However, when it comes to NBFCs, the RBI measures have largely benefited the AAA-rated companies. The RBI did two rounds of Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO). In the first round announced on March 27, the RBI did Rs 1 lakh crore worth of TLTRO.The second round of auctions \u2014 TLTRO 2.0 for Rs 50,000 crore was announced on April 17. The first auction of TLTRO 2.0 conducted yesterday has however pointed to a muted response. Against the Rs 25,000 crore offered, the RBI received bids worth only half of the amount. This pointed towards higher risk aversion in the banking sector to lend to small NBFCs and MFIs despite the RBI offering cheaper money at 4.40 percent.Announcing the MF window, the RBI also announced a few measures to make the scheme attractive for banks. Under this, liquidity support availed would be eligible to be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25 percent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio.

It is an unfortunate event. Franklin Templeton brought the concept of accrual debt investing to Indian investors who were otherwise always mispredicting the movement of interest rates and never made fine returns in debt.First of all, let's stop calling the corporate bond market as a low-quality debt. Here is the definition of AA, and A-rated corporate bonds as per rating agencies - AA means high credit quality, and A means adequate credit quality. These are considered to be investment-grade corporate bonds as allowed by SEBI for debt mutual funds.Secondly, the rating is not the sole mechanism to understand the quality of the company. ILFS & DHFL were AAA. There are many other factors.Thirdly, India is a developing country. AA and A-rated companies are much more in number and no less important than AAA companies. For that matter, one should check India's rating. It is BBB-(Fitch).Fourthly, NBFCs are the most important part of the Indian financial system. Some AA and A-rated NBFCs are very finely working towards stalwart visions of \"financial inclusion\" set by PM Modi. Their asset quality is better than many AAA financial companies.Hence, the AA and A companies that are held by Franklin Templeton should not be blindly termed as low-quality corporations. Most of the companies are large corporates with more than 10-15 years of history, offering strong products and services, with well-established brands and many are listed companies with diversified businesses. Many are leaders in their respective industry. And, some less known ones, have got have a series of PE funding in the last three years. Overall, the portfolio is well-diversified across various sectors.Of course, these companies have higher risk profile if one just goes by rating and compares to AAA. The problem is not an isolated event as it\u2019s not the problem of the credit crisis. Its the problem of liquidity given the unprecedented situation. The reason responsible for the liquidity crisis is a perceptual risk aversion and flight to safety given the uncertain situation created by COVID-19 and lockdown.With this understanding, industry & regulators need to come together to ensure that the situation is handled properly. Announcements must be made by regulators on steps being taken to ensure the Franklin Templeton investor interest is not compromised.Lastly, the industry needs to understand that 3.1\u00a0lakh investors of Franklin Templeton are common investors to all AMCs. Calling this event isolation is not at all going to enforce the investors' trust. Every AMC instead of boasting about their AAA portfolio percentages should spread wisdom on the fact that all AA or A-rated companies are not low-quality debt.India\u2019s rating is BBB- So are we a low-quality nation? Don\u2019t we see great potential in our economy? Investors\u2019 fear cannot be addressed by showing them AAA portfolios. It is like running away from reality. The industry needs to take the responsibility of educating investors that AA and A doesn't necessarily mean a default.Fear is like darkness.

But Templeton\u2019s action could impact the trust of investors in other liquid funds even in those ones that are relatively in a better liquidity position, industry observers said.If the crisis spills over, the lack of trust could result in an exodus of funds to safer assets including bank fixed deposits and gold. \u201cBanks could see a flood of deposits in near term,\u201d said Pratip Chaudhuri, former chairman of State Bank of India.As investors\u00a0look for safer assets, bank deposits \u2014 despite the lower returns they offer \u2014 may see more preference since safety will be\u00a0sought-after over returns.\u00a0Some mutual funds will face high redemption pressure in the short-term, experts said.\u201cThe event will shake the trust of the investor and there is redemption likely. This money could go to banks till the time banks there is clarity,\u201d said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Securities.Templeton announced closure of six funds \u2014 Franklin India Low Duration Fund (FILDF), Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund (FIIOF) effective April 23. Total assets under management of these funds are estimated around Rs 25,000 crore.\u201cThere is a spill-over effect likely to other funds, equity markets and I won\u2019t be surprised if banks become the last resort for investors,\u201d said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banker.In 2008, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the RBI had stepped in to save the mutual funds industry. The central bank then opened a special window to provide banks with funds to support mutual funds.The RBI then cut the amount of funds banks must keep in reserve, releasing more than $12 billion into the banking system,\u00a0 injected $13 billion via its daily overnight money market operations and introduced a temporary funding window for mutual funds.This time around, if the crisis spills over to the broader money markets, the RBI could come with a similar window to help banks with liquidity for mutual funds, bankers and analysts said.In fact, in the recent days, the RBI has been already doing that. Of late, it has actively engaged with markets to ensure liquidity in the market to nullify the impact of COVID-19 crisis. But, this has largely benefited the AAA-rated companies.The RBI did two rounds of Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO). In the first round announced on March 27, the RBI did Rs 1 lakh crore worth of TLTRO. The second round of auctions \u2014 TLTRO 2.0 for Rs 50,000 crore was announced on 17 April.The first auction of TLTRO 2.0 conducted yesterday has however pointed to a muted response. Against the Rs 25,000 crore offered, RBI received bids worth only half of the amount. This pointed towards higher risk aversion in the banking sector to lend to small NBFCs and MFIs despite RBI offering cheaper money at 4.40 percent.\u201cIt is bit premature to say what the impact of this action will be on bond market. This is, till now, a fund specific problem,\u201d said Kumaresh Ramakrishnan, CIO Fixed Income, PGIM India Mutual Fund."], "tags": "#Business#Companies#Economy#Franklin Templeton#Franklin Templeton India crisis#RBI"},

However, now the university has indicated that the programme could be initially offered online due to the coronavirus outbreak.\"The whole point of enrolling for postgraduate programmes at a US university is the experience of being in the campus. While I have time till mid-May to decide on the enrollment, I am no longer keen to pursue an online programme,\" she said.The upcoming fall semester in the United States is scheduled to begin from August 2020. Considering that average education costs for a year in the US is around Rs 30 lakh, both students and parents are wary of opting for an online programme.While online programme modules are being offered for individuals who are unable to travel to the host country to enroll into the problems, students seem to be wary. On one hand while there is no clarity on when students will be allowed to get to the campus, on the other there is no clarity on how will the fee be refunded if classes are suspended, or are moved completely online.Georgia Institute of Technology has said that international students who cannot obtain their visas and who are admitted into a Master's degree programme that has an online option may start their programme in the online option. The student can then choose to either continue in the online option or transfer to the Atlanta campus the following semester after receiving their student visa.The biggest concern for students is that since foreign education involves taking large loans, some payment flexibility must be given.Varun Vohra, a design programme aspirant, immediately checked with two institutes where he has been shortlisted, one in Italy and the other in the United States about the refund policy. But both refused to offer any clarity.\"I was told that no decision has been taken yet on reducing the fee. The institutes said that the fees are used to support a lot of campus and student activities and hence there is little possibility of a decrease. But I need to apply for a Rs 25 lakh student loan and would need clarity on what are the chances of the course commencing and if a later decision could be taken on financial aid,\" he added.Moneycontrol had  that a revival of academic activities in campus involving physical lectures looks feasible only by January 2021. On one hand, while regions like Australia, New Zealand and Japan could see higher interest from 2021 onwards, consultants said that US and UK could fall out of favour for the time-being.A few institutes have stated that they are on schedule as of now, but the evolving COVID-19 situation may force a lot of academic calendar changes and postponements.Boston University said in a statement on its website that it is planning to resume its on-campus residential programme in the fall of 2020.However, as per its recovery plan, the university said that in the unlikely event that public health officials deem it unsafe to open in the fall of 2020, then the contingency plan envisions the need to consider a later in-person return, perhaps in January 2021.\"It also accepts the possibility that international students are likely to face unique burdens, such as travel restrictions and interruptions in the processing of visas, and it suggests that some popular master\u2019s programs may have to be offered remotely,\u201d said the statement.A few international institutes are also facilitating some flexibility for the students who are enrolling into the programmes.Ravneet Pahwa, Deputy Vice President (Global Engagement) and CEO (South Asia) of Australia\u2019s Deakin University told Moneycontrol that for new students, the institute has \u00a0started Deakin degrees online.\"While being in their home country itself, these students can start their education and enroll in a few subjects rather than wasting time. Their credits will be transferred to their on-campus education as soon as it opens up,\" she said.Australia usually enrolls new students in July every year. But this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak, no new physical enrollments are being done. About 100,000 Indians study in Australia.Pahwa added that Deakin is doing provisional enrollment of students where they can provide the final college marksheets before a cut-off date in August. If a student does not wish to continue or has seen a delay in result declaration, there is also a provision for 100 percent refund of the fee paid for the subjects studied online.Currently, almost 1 million Indian students are estimated to be studying across universities in US, UK, Europe, Australia and parts of South-East Asia.

If that is the case, then those mothers are very likely to have a difficult time keeping up with their obligations at work,\" Scharff said.In the state of Nebraska, waitresses, hairdressers, cosmetologists and retail salespeople topped the list of workers seeking benefits, jobs more likely held by women than by men, the data showed.\"Women are less likely to be in careers which can quickly shift to teleworking than men,\" Scharff said."], "tags": "#coronavirus#jobs#US"},

We'll never call it 'coronabonds' or 'eurobonds' and it will be raised by the Commission, rather than member states together,\" said another senior EU diplomat involved in preparing the summit.\"There is plenty of detail still missing and there will be plenty of fights ahead to nail it down.

Crude prices nosedived from an average $55 per barrel in February to $33 in March and around $20 at the end of March as demand slumped because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The mayhem in the oil market meant that by the time crude oil is processed and converted into fuel, the rates have fallen, resulting in inventory losses.\"For oil refiners, the COVID-19 pandemic is delivering two blows: inventory loss of over Rs 25,000 crore in the January-March quarter because of a 70% fall in crude oil prices, and a likely plunge in gross refining margins (GRMs) in the first quarter (April-June) of fiscal 2021 because of demand destruction,\" Crisil said in a note.Oil cartel OPEC and its allies on April 12 managed to strike a deal for a record production cut of 9.7 million barrels per day. Yet crude prices have hovered low because of the pandemic-induced plunge in demand across the globe.\"This has caught refiners on the wrong foot,\" it said.India has a total refining capacity of 250 million metric tonnes per annum and refiners keep an inventory of 20-50 days of crude on average to avoid disruption in operations.The rapid fall in crude oil prices would mean an inventory loss of $10-20 per barrel.\"The loss would be offset once crude oil prices rebound, but the process would take time given that the slump in global demand is expected to prolong,\" it said.Sachin Gupta, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings, said: \"Inventory losses would be more for refineries located away from the coast because they have to stock crude oil for longer periods. That means refiners will have to borrow more working capital to fund the crude oil purchased earlier.\"In addition to these inventory losses, the operating performance of refiners is expected to remain weak in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to lower volumes and lower GRMs.\"With demand culled further because of the extension of nationwide lockdown up to May 3, 2020, refineries are staring\u00a0at a halving of utilisation during the April-June quarter.\"Refineries that replenished their product inventory are staring at the significant curtailment of operations. Our base-case assumes the lockdown lasting for up to 1.5 months, with another 1 to 1.5 months required to resume and stabilise operations,\" it said.Additionally, refining margins on high-yield products such as aviation turbine fuel (ATF), petrol and diesel have plummeted and are expected to remain weak over the near term. That will affect the operating metrics of refiners.However, oil marketing companies would fare better than standalone refiners because of higher marketing margins for some products, it said, adding the retail prices of petrol have not fallen in tandem with crude oil prices, which implies higher marketing margins.Nitesh Jain, Director, Crisil Ratings, said: \"Lower throughput and lower margins resulting from suppressed demand outlook will hurt the credit metrics of oil refiners. Though strong government/parent support will lend a shoulder, and continue to support the overall credit profiles of refiners.\"Revival in demand and improvement in GRMs will be key monitorables in the road ahead."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Crisil#Economy#Market news"},

In response to the deepening economic crisis, the House passed a nearly USD 500 billion spending package to help buckled businesses and hospitals.More than 4.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the government reported. In all, roughly 26 million people \u2014 the population of the 10 biggest US cities combined \u2014 have now filed for jobless aid in five weeks, an epic collapse that has raised the stakes in the debate over how and when to ease the shutdowns of factories and other businesses.In the hardest-hit corner of the US, evidence emerged that perhaps 2.7 million New York state residents have been infected by the virus \u2014 10 times the number confirmed by lab tests.A small, preliminary statewide survey of around 3,000 people found that nearly 14 per cen had antibodies showing they had been infected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.Just in New York City, with a population of 8.6 million, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said as many as 1 million may have been infected.In Washington, many House lawmakers wore face masks and bandannas \u2014 and some sat in the otherwise vacant visitors gallery to stay away from others \u2014 as they debated the latest spending package.A near-unanimous vote sent it to President Donald Trump in the evening.Anchoring the bill is the administration's USD 250 billion request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses.Trump said the bill \u201cwill help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.\u201dAbroad, there was mixed news about the epidemic.Some countries, including Greece, Bangladesh and Malaysia, announced extensions of their lockdowns.Vietnam, New Zealand and Croatia were among those moving to end or ease such measures.In Africa, COVID-19 cases surged 43% in the past week to 26,000, according to John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organisation that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in Africa and push 30 million into desperate poverty.Brazil's health ministry confirmed 407 deaths due to the outbreak in the last 24 hours, a daily high for the country.Huge lines have formed at food banks from El Paso, Texas, to the Paris suburbs, and food shortages are hitting Africa especially hard.At a virtual summit, European Union leaders agreed to set up a massive recovery fund to help rebuild the 27-nation bloc's ravaged economies.While no figure was put on the plan, officials said 1-1.5 trillion euros ($1.1-1.6 trillion) would be needed.The coronavirus has killed over 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and nearly 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures.The true numbers are almost certainly far higher.In the US, the economic consequences of the shutdowns have sparked angry rallies in state capitals by protesters demanding that businesses reopen, and Trump has expressed impatience over the restrictions.Some governors have begun easing up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking a second wave of infections.In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.Few Americans count on Trump as a reliable source of information on the outbreak, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 23% said they have high levels of trust in what he tells the public, while 21% said they trust him a moderate amount.On the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%.But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.Janet Simon, laid off as a waitress at a Miami IHOP restaurant, said she has just $200 and is getting panic attacks because of uncertainty over how she will care for her three children.Simon, 33, filed for unemployment a month ago, and her application is still listed as \u201cpending.\u201d\u201cI'm doing everything to keep my family safe, my children safe, but everything else around me is falling apart,\u201d Simon said.\u201cBut they see it, no matter how much I try to hide my despair.\"Corey Williams, 31, lost his warehouse job in Michigan a month ago and saw his rent, insurance and other bills pile up while he anxiously awaited his unemployment benefits.That finally happened on Wednesday, and he quickly paid $1,700 in bills.\u201cIt was getting pretty tight, pretty tight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was definitely stressful for the last few days.\u201d"], "tags": "#coronavirus#Covid-19#United States#world"},

House members were meeting for the first time in weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.Lawmakers, many wearing masks, approved the bill during an extended period of voting intended to allow them to remain at a distance from one another in line with public health recommendations.The House action sent the latest of four relief bills to the White House. Republican President Donald Trump, who backs the measure, said he would probably sign it into law on Thursday evening.The Republican-led Senate had passed the legislation on a voice vote on Tuesday. But threats of opposition by some members of both parties prompted congressional leaders to call the full chamber back to Washington for the House vote despite state stay-at-home orders meant to control the spread of the virus.The House also approved a select committee, with subpoena power, to probe the U.S. response to the coronavirus. It will have broad powers to investigate how federal dollars are being spent, U.S. preparedness and Trump administration deliberations.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the panel was essential to ensure funds go to those who need them and to prevent scams. Republicans said the committee was not needed, citing existing oversight bodies, and called the panel's creation another expensive Democratic slap at Trump. The committee was approved on a vote of 212-182, along party lines.The $484 billion aid bill was the fourth passed to address the coronavirus crisis. It provides funds to small businesses and hospitals struggling with the economic toll of a pandemic that has killed almost 50,000 people in the United States and thrown 26 million out of work, wiping out all the jobs created during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.A handful of lawmakers opposed the legislation, including Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a severely affected area of New York and believes Congress should do even more - and Republican Thomas Massie, known as \"Mr. No\" for his frequent opposition to spending bills.\"This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 dead, a huge number of people, and the uncertainty of it all,\" Pelosi said during debate on the bill.Congress passed the last coronavirus relief measure, worth more than $2 trillion, in March, also with overwhelming support from both parties. It was the largest such funding bill ever passed.The next step will be harder. The two parties have set the stage for a fight over additional funding for state and local governments reeling from the impact of lost revenue after Republicans refused to include such funds in the current relief bill.Trump has said he supports more funding for states, and has promised to back it in future legislation.Congressional Republicans have resisted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in a radio interview on Wednesday that states could go bankrupt, but said later he did not want states to use federal funds for anything unrelated to the coronavirus.Democrats castigated McConnell for the remark. \"Leader McConnell said to our cities and states, to our cops and firemen and teachers, he told them to drop dead,\" said Representative Max Rose, who represents a district of New York City.Thursday's voting took place under safety protocols that considerably dragged out proceedings. Lawmakers came to the House in alphabetical order in small groups and were told to stand in line, 6 feet (1.8 m) apart, before entering the chamber.There was also a half-hour break scheduled to clean the chamber between the two votes.

China has called the rules \"discriminatory\".Some Chinese investors have already \"put things on hold\" as they await further clarity on the rules, said Vaibhav Kakkar of Indian law firm L&L Partners.\"Every Chinese investor is worried, any government approval could take months,\" said Kakkar, who advises several foreign companies and investors.This will affect India's digital businesses who are in dire need of funds to tide over the coronavirus crisis, he said.MG Motor and Great Wall are concerned about the policy and its possible implications on future investment plans, according to four sources familiar with the thinking.While MG started selling cars in India last year, it is yet to fully invest the $650 million it has committed to India. Great Wall is yet to start production in India but said in February it plans to invest $1 billion in the coming years.\"Sentiment wise it's not been taken well but it will not change the investment plans for now,\" said one of the sources who works closely with Chinese automakers in India.MG Motor and Great Wall did not respond to a request for comment.Indian craft beer maker Bira's roughly $50 million of bridge financing round that involved Chinese investors could be delayed due to the new rules, said an industry source with direct knowledge. Bira did not respond to a request for comment.India's industries ministry is reviewing several queries received since the policy was made public over the weekend, but it has not been decided if further clarifications will be issued, a government official told Reuters.The new rules govern entities located in a country that shares a land border with India. Such foreign direct investments will now require government approval, meaning they can't go through a so-called automatic route, and will also apply on investments from Hong Kong, Reuters has reported.The policy risks souring relations between the two nations and furthering anti-China sentiment already festering in India before the coronavirus outbreak.Companies regularly battle consumer perception that Chinese goods are of inferior quality and those views have only worsened as the coronavirus epidemic spread from China around the world.Welcoming the investment rules, Ashwani Mahajan of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a Hindu nationalist group close to India's ruling party, said domestic startups should not rely on any Chinese funding as there was enough local capital available.\"We have even more reasons to oppose China now there is a general feeling against China, and secondly we have been saying Chinese goods are of bad quality,\" said Mahajan.Federal think tank Niti Aayog's chief executive Amitabh Kant defended the screening of investments and rejected the notion it was targeting China."], "tags": "#Business#China#coronavirus#Economy#foreign direct investment (FDI)#India"},

It featured the Sino-US trade war, general elections in India, market euphoria, Brexit, a faltering Indian economy, a crisis in the non-banking financial sector, a bank collapse and rescue, a U-turn by the US Fed and the virus attack, a meltdown in the markets and a lockdown.We have been beside the investor at every step of the journey, guiding her, whispering words of advice, cautioning her and dancing with her till the music stopped. We have since been calming her, listening to her worries, holding her hand, picking up diamonds in the dust and preparing her for the next dance.If I were to single out one value that we prize above all else, it is, simply put, an unflinching commitment to the unvarnished truth. We have always called a spade a spade, often preferring to call it a bloody shovel.There are numerous examples --- we had, for instance, consistently raised red flags about the bubble that had formed in the equity markets before the virus hit, a bubble that was in search of a pin. We had at an early date pointed out the weakness in the Indian economy and how the equity markets were increasingly divorced from fundamentals. And we were one of the first to warn that the virus could lead to a financial crisis.In short, we call it as we see it. And the reason we can do that is because we are completely independent.

That is why we have spared no effort in bringing you the gist of reports brought out by international agencies and analysed the policies of central banks in the developed countries that have an impact on fund flows to India and emerging markets.To take one important instance, we have always pointed out the role central banks in the developed world have played in boosting the asset markets.And finally, we have endeavoured to say all these things in simple, sharp, direct, jargon-free language, for your reading pleasure.We are passing through a painful time, but it is also a historic one. There is great uncertainty. Which businesses will thrive after the virus passes, which will go under?Will there be a wave of bankruptcies? Will globalisation, already under threat before the virus reared its ugly head, go into reverse? What will be the impact of the tsunami of debt and liquidity that central banks and governments have unleashed?Will it create an even bigger asset bubble?

"], "time": ["Last Updated : Apr 22, 2020 10:36 PM IST    | Source: "], "source": ["Reuters"], "article": ["The euro zone economy is already in its deepest recession on record, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who have stuck to a bleak outlook and worry the downturn might be even worse as coronavirus lockdowns across the bloc take their toll.That comes despite the European Central Bank (ECB) pledging to buy more than 1 trillion euros in assets this year to cushion the blow and governments outlining hundreds of billions in spending plans to bridge businesses and support workers.The latest Reuters poll, taken April 14-22, showed the bloc's economy contracting by 3.1 percent in the first quarter and 9.6 percent in the current quarter. That compares with 3.3 percent and 9.3 percent contractions, respectively, predicted in a poll published on April 3.Those forecasts for the quarter-on-quarter downturn have not changed much over the past few weeks, unlike the outlook for the United States. But if realised, this quarter would mark the sharpest decline on record.The euro zone economy was then expected to grow 5.2 percent in the third quarter and 2.9 percent in the final quarter of this year, compared with 6.0 percent and 2.0 percent forecast in the poll a few weeks ago.But 95 percent of economists said the risk to their forecasts for the second half of this year were skewed more to the downside.\"The deeper the recession goes and the longer it lasts, it increases the risk that we have more damage to the supply potential of the economy since the likelihood of workers becoming unemployed and companies going bust is high,\" said Spyros Andreopoulos, senior European economist at BNP Paribas.\"The policy response has so far been less decisive. That's why we don't expect to go back to the previous baseline forecasts for growth soon.\"For 2020 as a whole, GDP was forecast to contract 5.4 percent, the worst year since the common currency was introduced in 1999. That is still better than the International Monetary Fund's latest forecast for a decline of 7.5 percent.But asked for their worst-case scenario, the median view was for a 12.0 percent contraction in 2020. Reflecting the high level of uncertainty, the forecasts ranged from -5.0 percent to -21.0 percent.\"It is difficult to think that things will return to normal right after the lockdown. There will be some changes on the supply and demand side because behaviors are going to be changed for quite a while,\" said Philippe Gudin, chief European economist at Barclays.\"Will people return to their old habits, will they travel again quickly? There is huge uncertainty but for sure the risk to our scenario is to the downside.\"About 70 percent of nearly 50 economists who responded to an additional question said the recovery would either take the shape of a \"U\" or a tick mark. Only one-fifth expect it to be a quick, \"V\"-shaped recovery.The euro zone's three largest economies - Germany, France and Italy - have been severely affected by the COVID-19 virus and while the curve for new cases has declined, the lockdowns were still in place.Germany's economy was expected to contract 5.3 percent this year, France's by 5.5 percent, Spain's by 6.6 percent, with Italy taking the biggest hit, shrinking 7.8 percent this year, medians from the poll showed.The IMF estimated -7.0 percent for Germany, -7.2 percent for France, -8.0 percent for Spain and Italy was estimated to contract 9.1 percent.But the range of views for this year in the latest Reuters poll for all were wide, from no growth for Germany to as low as -18 percent for Italy.Over three-quarters of economists, 30 of 38, who answered another question said the ECB was not yet done easing policy.Most respondents predicted the ECB would increase existing asset purchases. Some said it would eventually have to start buying exchange-traded funds like the Bank of Japan currently does.A majority of economists said the ECB would exhaust its 750 billion euros of additional pandemic-response asset purchases and 120 billion euro of already-announced purchases, with a few forecasting it to be done by the end of September.Most said the ECB would increase the size of these programmes rather than end them. The ECB's balance sheet, currently around 5.3 trillion euros, was expected to grow to 6.2 trillion euros by end-2020 and expand further to 6.7 trillion euros by end-2021.\"We think the ECB is at this stage a sufficient backstop,\" said BNP Paribas' Andreopoulos. \"But at the same time, the ECB is operating in a different legal and political framework than the Fed or the Bank of Japan and therefore we are a lot less certain that the ECB will be able to provide an indefinite backstop to countries.\""], "tags": "#Business#Economy#European Central Bank#France#Germany#Italy#Spain#World News"},

There are 66 NBFC-MFIs under Sadhan. \u201cIf the rating stipulation can be up to BB, many of these companies will benefit. Very few have BBB-. One should understand the profile of these companies.

Only one company has AA rating. MFIs typically lend to low-income borrowers, who are mostly daily wage earners or run micro businesses. These loans are given for 18-24 months at a rate of 21-23 percent. The average loan ticket size is around Rs 30,000.Meeting the 90-day repayment requirement is impossible for NBFC-MFIs and MSMEs to comply since their cash flows\u00a0have dried up severely. The bigger NBFCs may have the bargaining power to negotiate roll over of these loans beyond 90-days that will then lead to evergreening of loans. But, small firms with low rating do not stand a chance.Banks typically prefer big companies with top ratings for giving loans due to the perceived high-risk. Banks fear that once the lock-down period is over, MFIs will see large scale defaults and RBI\u2019s temporary measures may not come to their rescue then.

The virus has killed more than 45,000 people in the United States, more than any other country.But Kemp and other governors are keen to get their economies rolling again, which would bring in income and sales taxes, the main revenue sources for most states. The lockdown has decimated state budgets, and the latest federal government coronavirus aid bill, set to be passed this week, does not include new money for state and local governments in part because Trump administration officials and some Republicans were concerned it could deter them from reopening.Georgia has fewer coronavirus cases and deaths per capita than the national average, but one of the lowest rates of testing.

This risk-aversion in the industry has weakened the RBI's efforts to pump liquidity into the banking system to help small non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs).\"Limited participation by banks in the TLTRO 2.0 clearly highlights the bank's reluctance to lend to mid-size and small NBFCs and MFIs in the current situation.\u00a0 Given the lack of risk appetite in banks, a structure with partial credit guarantee by the GoI, similar to the PCG scheme launched last year for Securitization, maybe the only viable option to ease liquidity challenges of NBFCs,\" Brickwork Ratings said in a note.NBFCs and MFIs are facing stretched liquidity conditions given that banks are very selective while giving moratorium to these entities whereas the NBFCs and MFIs have already approved the loan moratorium to most of their borrowers, the agency said.On April 17,  announced the second round of targeted LTRO under the tag of TLTRO 2.0 for an amount of Rs 50,000 crore to begin with. The idea was to continue with liquidity support for banks to lend to small NBFCs and microfinance institutions in the context of the Covid-19 economic impact.Banks under TLTRO 2.0 should be invested in investment grade bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 percent of the total amount availed going to small and mid-sized NBFCs and MFIs, the RBI said, adding these investments have to be made within one month of the availment of liquidity from the RBI.Prior to this, the RBI had conducted LTROs worth Rs One lakh crore. But, most of these funds went to big companies as banks chose to play safe. Investments made by banks under TLTRO facility will be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25 percent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio, the RBI said. Also, to incentivise banks use this facility, the RBI said exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework.With poor response received in the first auction, the RBI will review the auction results and take a view in the matter, the RBI said. This is no good news for NBFCs as the auction results prove that making excess liquidity alone will not do the trick. Banks are not keen to lend to lower rated NBFCs and MFIs fearing default.Even the refinance scheme announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 17 April, intended to help small non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and microfinance institutions, is lacking appeal among small companies. will ultimately not benefit the smaller companies that are gasping for funds.In his second presser to address COVID-19 relief measures, the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced refinancing support to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore through all India financial institutions such as Nabard, SIDBI and NHB.But, according to the terms in the circular issued by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to CMDs of commercial banks, NBFCs and MFIs, under the tag of 'scheme for special liquidity support for MSMEs' (micro, small and medium enterprises), the loan needs to be repaid within a period of 90 days. Also, MFIs and small companies need to have a minimum BBB- rating as on March, 31.These two conditions will cut off a good number of MFIs and small companies from benefitting from the scheme."], "tags": "#RBI#TLTRO"},

For the first quarter of the year imports were up 5 percent.The price collapse is battering state-owned oil producers and possibly disrupting official plans to develop the industry but is a boon to Chinese drivers and factories. It gives Beijing a chance to add to a strategic petroleum reserve that is meant to insulate the country against possible supply disruptions.\u201cIn the midst of all this, China oil imports have been resilient, as low prices have enabled stockpiling,\u201d said Peter Lee, senior oil and gas analyst for Fitch Solutions.As global prices fell, Chinese importers sent 84 tankers to Saudi Arabia in mid-March, each able to carry 2 million barrels of crude, according to news reports that cited the China Shipbuilding Industry Association.Low oil prices \u201chave a positive impact on China,\u201d said the ruling Communist Party\u2019s Political and Legal Commission on its social media account.Still, the plunge threatens to disrupt plans to make China more \u201cenergy self-reliant\u201d if state-owned drillers have to cut spending on developing domestic oilfields, said industry analyst Max Petrov of Wood Mackenzie.State-owned PetroChina Ltd., Asia\u2019s biggest producer, is \u201cprobably losing quite serious amounts of money,\u201d said Petrov. He said PetroChina has to decide whether to follow the lead of Western producers and slash spending on new wells.\u201cIf it cuts investment, and because of the nature of China\u2019s oilfields, it will take a very long time for production to come back up,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cIt will take years and even more money.\u201dBeijing also appears to be adding to its strategic stockpile, though details are secret.The Cabinet\u2019s National Energy Administration reported in September that total reserves held by the government and oil companies were equal to 80 days of consumption.The official reserve stands at about 385 million barrels, according to Lee of Fitch Solutions. He said plans appear to call for increasing that to 500 to 600 million barrels.If enough additional storage capacity is built, the government might import 500,000 to 900,000 barrels per day for the strategic reserve, or 5 percent to 9 percent of China\u2019s total foreign purchases, according to Lee.The government reserve uses three tank farms and state media say a fourth might be under construction.The energy administration referred questions to the Cabinet\u2019s planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. The NDRC didn\u2019t respond Wednesday.The Communist Party commission said the plunge in prices gives Beijing a unique chance to build up that reserve but gave no indication the government was doing that.\u201cThis is a once-a-century opportunity!\u201d the commission said.That might be hard to do, because like other countries China is running out of empty storage capacity, said Lei Sun of Wood Mackenzie.The strategic reserve and private suppliers had filled up at least 85 percent percent of their total storage capacity by February and added more oil in March, according to Lei. He said space that is left might be filled up with crude bought earlier at higher prices that Chinese buyers are forced to accept even though they had no customers.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is going to be any leftover space for crude,\u201d said Lei.Cheaper crude is one of China\u2019s few economic bright spots in the coronavirus pandemic.The economy suffered its worst contraction since the mid-\u201960s in the first quarter, shrinking 6.8 percent from a year earlier after Beijing closed factories and told some 800 million people to stay home.Forecasters expect little to no growth this year, down from 2019\u2019s 6.1 percent, which already was a multi-decade low.That is politically risky for the ruling party, which bases its claim to power on associating itself with China\u2019s economic success.China's two other major state-owned oil companies \u2014 Sinopec Ltd. and CNOOC \u2014 also are believed to be considering cuts in investment.China has relied increasingly on imported oil and gas since the late 1990s as manufacturing, car ownership and airline travel boomed.Imports make up about half of consumption. Half of that comes from the Middle East and the rest from Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa.The ruling party wants to curb that reliance, which communist leaders see as a security risk. That is a major factor behind Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar investments in hydro, wind and solar power."], "tags": "#Business#China#coronavirus#Crude oil#Economy#World News"},

Site managers no longer come to the intersection where Dayaram and many others stand, hoping to pick up work.And so, with no way to feed his family or pay the rent, Dayaram hoisted his son Shivam onto his shoulders and began to walk to the village where he was born, 300 miles away.He tried not to worry about what would happen once he got there, with empty pockets instead of the money he usually sent home to help support those left behind. At least he would have a home.By dusk on the second day, Dayaram and around 50 others from his extended family had reached a deserted expressway running south out of the capital.The family were hungry, thirsty and tired, and the police were never far away. Every time they stopped to rest, officers would shout at them to keep moving in single file, to maintain distance from one another to avoid spreading the virus. Officers are under orders to enforce the lockdown, but on that day they were allowing people to move.Dayaram, 28, looked around. Thousands of other migrant workers were doing the same thing, in one of the biggest mass movements of people in the country since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.It began to rain. Dayaram's thoughts turned to his other son, 7-year-old Mangal, who had been left behind in the village with elderly relatives because it was too hard to care for two children while he and his wife worked. He missed him.In the middle of a pandemic, there was one consolation: \"At least I will be with him.\"For decades, villages across India have been emptying out.To many people, the decision is one of simple arithmetic: to earn $6 per day instead of $3 back home. In areas like the parched Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh state, home to Dayaram's ancestral village, living off the land has become increasingly difficult as rainfall recedes.Others seek something more abstract: the prospect of escape that pulls anyone toward a big city.But after the shutdown, the cities themselves began to empty. Dayaram and his family were among the first to move. As the days went on, and the situation became more desperate, hundreds of thousands of migrants emerged from factories and workplaces in search of a way home.Indian officials say the shutdown is necessary to beat coronavirus in the densely populated country of 1.3 billion people, with a health infrastructure that can ill afford a widespread outbreak.But for Dayaram and many of India's estimated 140 million migrant laborers, the epidemic is much more than a threat to their health \u201c it endangers their very economic survival.:\u00a0In the shutdown, India has banned domestic and international travel, and factories, schools, offices and all shops other than those supplying essential services have been shut. Taken together, the measures amount to one of the harshest lockdowns in the world.Cases here have spiked to nearly 17,000, with more than 500 deaths. On April 14, the government extended the curbs until at least May 3, prompting clashes between police and migrants trying to leave India's financial capital, Mumbai.Migrants are the backbone of the urban economy. Construction workers such as Dayaram are a necessity for India's rapidly expanding cities. Others clean toilets, drive taxis and deliver takeout. They predominantly earn daily wages, with no prospect of job security, and live in dirty, densely populated slums, saving money to send back home.That money is essential to the young and elderly left behind in villages. Around $30 billion flows from urban to rural areas in India each year, according to government and academic estimates.Now that infusion of money, transferred through rural banks or in worn stacks of rupees borne home on rare visits, has come to a halt.The journey from New Delhi deep into rural India is one not just of distance, but of traveling back in time.Skyscrapers and well-paved toll roads give way to fields of wheat and okra. Bare-backed men till the land with buffalo; an elderly shepherd herds his goats down a dusty lane.After four days of walking and hitching lifts on a series of goods trucks, Dayaram, Gyanvati and Shivam reached their family's two-room concrete hut in Jugyai, a farming village of 2,000 people.In a dingy room in the house filled with sacks of grain and clothes, an unframed poster hangs on the wall. It depicts a handsome red-roofed house on a lake, sun setting behind snow-capped mountains. A pair of mallard ducks fly overhead.\"I want to turn the clock back to when people lived in small villages and took care of each other,\" it says.Though he can't read the English text on the poster, Dayaram agrees with the sentiment. He misses this village that can no longer sustain him.\"It's not that I love Delhi,\" he said. \"I need the money to survive. If we had it, we would have stayed here. This is home.\"His mother, 53-year-old Kesra, is more practical. She too had gone to New Delhi with her family, leaving the village behind.\"Home is wherever the family is,\" she said. \"At least in Delhi there is money to buy food.\"But now they are all back, and there is no money to buy food. Making it even worse, suspicion is never far away. The returnees must deal with new prejudice from villagers who used to be their friends.\"I am scared,\" said Sai Ram Lal, a neighbor who works in a soybean-oil factory here.\"It was spreading in Delhi, and I am worried that they have brought it here. We keep our distance. We don't interact with them like we used to before.\"For Dayaram, that has left him an outsider in his own village.The Bundelkhand region is famous for the towering 16th century sandstone temples and mausoleums of nearby Orchha. It has its own distinct culture, and young men still listen to high-tempo music in the local Bundeli language on their mobile phones.The region used to get up to 35 inches of rain per year, according to the India Meteorological Department, but over the last decade, that has almost halved.For many of the villagers, who have traditionally earned their living farming, it is a slow-motion disaster, forcing most able-bodied men and women to migrate in search of work.It is early April, and even before the full onset of the fierce Indian summer, where temperatures climb toward 50 degrees Celsius, or 120 Fahrenheit, the air is already uncomfortably dry.In a neighboring village where the majority of Dayaram's extended family lives, two dozen men stood idling by the road.Only one, 62-year-old Lal Ram, has never been to Delhi. \"I had some money, so I never went,\" he said with a shrug.He's also the only one with a ration card, a sore point for those who migrated to Delhi. The Targeted Public Distribution Scheme allows India's poorest to purchase 5 kilograms of subsidized grains per month each. But because the migrant workers are no longer permanent residents, they're left without access to the food doled out from a nearby grain silo.\"Nobody listens to us,\" one of the men said bitterly. \"We are like garbage.\"Harshika Singh, the top government official in the district where both villages lie, didn't respond to requests for comment on the migrants' case.Dayaram's father, 58-year-old Takur Das, was the first in the family to set off for New Delhi in search for work when it became increasingly difficult to make a living off the parched land.That was a decade ago. Eventually, he sent for his son, too. The work there was hard, but it was steady.\"We can get some money for your wedding,\" he told Dayaram.Many people in New Delhi would struggle to find Alipur, the Delhi suburb where they settled, on a map. It rarely makes the national news but for misfortune involving laborers: 25 children rescued by authorities in a series of warehouse raids; four men, including two brothers, crushed to death by sacks of rice.Dayaram says his heart sank when he saw the crowded, tarpaulin-roofed slum where the family slept 12 to a room. His first thought was to run away back to the village.But he stayed. What else could he do?Dayaram talks continuously about fate. His marriage, his move to New Delhi, his flight back home \u201c all were decisions made not out of choice, but necessity.Dayaram's maternal aunt played matchmaker when it came time for him to marry. He and Gyanvati were from the same Kushwaha caste, from a lower rung of India's ancient social order who traditionally worked in agriculture.They first met a month before their wedding day.\"She was OK,\" Dayaram said, a smile briefly crossing his face, remembering their meeting.\"But whatever is in my fate is fine, whether it is good or bad.\"After Mangal was born, Gyanvati stayed behind in Jugyai to look after him. When he was 1\u00c2\u00bd, she came to New Delhi with him, too.But after Shivam was born, they were faced with a choice: take Mangal, too, or leave him in the village.\"It's easier to carry one child while working, but two is too difficult,\" Gyanvati said. \"So we had to leave him behind.\"The family's return this month coincided with harvest of the winter wheat crop. One morning, after a night on a rope-strung bed under the light of the pink supermoon, Dayaram put on a shirt ripped at the left armpit and headed to a nearby field.His sons trailed behind, picking unripe berries from a bush. Shivam, wearing the same faded shirt in yellow checks as when he left New Delhi, put his hand on his elder brother's shoulder.Dayaram, Gyanvati and three other relatives began cropping stalks by hand with well-worn scythes. After three days there, harvesting almost a ton of wheat, they received no payment \u201c just 50 kilograms of the crop to take to the village flour mill.The family's basket of lumpen potatoes would last a week. When that ran out, they would have to survive on bread alone.In good months in New Delhi, they were able to save 8,000 rupees, or about $100, a month to send back home, and to repay a loan taken out when Gyanvati fell sick early in their marriage.But soon, Dayaram said, he would be forced to borrow again from local money lenders, charging interest at 3% a month \u201c a rate that can quickly spiral into unpayable debts.Despite being separated for months at a time, Mangal and Shivam are still close. Both have their father's broad nose and mother's lively eyes, the same matching bowl haircuts with unevenly shorn sides.\"They cut each other's hair,\" said Gyanvati, laughing. \"That's why they look like that.\"Both boys shrugged when asked if they wanted to go school, as if the issue had never really been discussed.Dayaram worries that the shutdown will end any hope of providing his children with an education.\"No parent wants their child to work as a laborer,\" he said. But there is no alternative, he said: \"They will have to do what I have done.\"Beneath the brilliant red blossoms of the Indian coral tree, the family finished the field on the stroke of midday, a white sun directly overhead.Mangal and Shivam were tired from chasing dragonflies through the freshly cropped stubble, and sat quietly watching cartoons on a mobile phone. Dayaram came over to where they were sitting. He wiped the sweat from his brow, looked at his boys and smiled."], "tags": "#coronavirus#coronavirus lockdown#Economy#India#migrant workers"},

It will be a pity to let the crisis go to waste. The current crisis will only last till a vaccine becomes available. We must think beyond that,\" Panagariya told PTI.\"After 70 years of development effort, we have still left our workers predominantly employed on tiny farms (70 million of them averaging less than a quarter hectare in size) and in informal or self-employment in tiny enterprises that give them barely subsistence level of income on a daily basis.\u201dPanagariya stressed that the COVID19 crisis has made it evident that India needs to create better paid, formal sector jobs and that requires moving workers out of tiny farms and enterprises into more productive and better paying jobs.\u201cThat in turn requires a shift of industrial and services activity away from micro enterprises to small, medium and large ones.\u201dAnother opportunity that looks to arise from the crisis is that there is bound to be acceleration of the movement of multinationals out of China into other parts of the world.\u201cMultinationals will be seeking greater diversification of their activities in the wake of Corona. India must not miss this opportunity,\u201d Panagariya said.He elaborated that one policy measure would be to give a serious thought to the creation of Autonomous Economic Zones in which local authorities are given as much authority to make policy as exists in Chinese cities such as Shenzhen.The crisis also gives the government the opportunity to introduce reforms in areas of land and labour markets that are harder in \"peace\" time, he said adding that the Land Acquisition Act must be reformed.Likewise, greater flexibility is necessary in labour markets so that enterprises in labour intensive sectors gain confidence to become larger thereby taking advantage of scale economies.Panagariya underscored that the government needs to be creative in lifting the lockdown going forward. He noted that in numerous districts, both rural and urban, where the cases of infection are fewer than ten, full freedom of movement within the district with strict enforcement of social-distancing and use of face masks can be permitted.In districts in which infections are concentrated in geographically narrow regions, free movement may be permitted in the remainder of the regions. \u201cAs this process proceeds, the government must keep all options open.

The United States has the highest infection numbers and deaths among individual nations.So far, the US Federal Reserve's policy of zero interest rates and unlimited asset purchases - which will likely expand its balance sheet to $10 trillion this year, according to the poll - as well as $2.3 trillion of federal government spending, have only softened the blow.In the latest Reuters poll taken April 15-20, before the price of US crude oil fell below zero per barrel on Monday, just under half of 45 respondents based in the US and Europe who answered an additional question said the US economic recovery would be \"U\" shaped, as represented on a chart tracking economic expansion or deceleration in percentage terms.Ten said it would be \"V\" shaped, seven said it would resemble a tick mark, and five said it would be \"W\" shaped.But economists, who have spent the last several weeks slashing forecasts by greater and greater amounts, were more doubtful than ever about the country's growth outlook, now that the longest expansion on record has abruptly ended.\"We've never gone through anything like this before. So, anyone who claims to have real expertise in these sort of issues, I think is not being honest.

So no, we're not going to get back to where we were - and forget getting above that for quite a while. Ultimately, with time and stimulus, the economy will recover, I'm confident of that.

The economy is now set for a 3.8 percent rebound in 2021, compared with 3.2 percent three weeks ago, the poll showed.Still, economists said the outlook could be far worse and prolonged, depending on the pandemic's course.\"Our central expectation is for a rebound in the second half of the year; however, that is riddled with uncertainty and downside risks,\" said Kevin Loane, senior economist at London-based Fathom Consulting.\"Among these are the risks that: lockdowns are extended longer than currently envisaged, there is a second wave of COVID-19 cases, temporary job losses are made permanent resulting in labor market friction, businesses fail resulting in wasted capital, or businesses and households remain fearful even without official lockdowns and opt not to spend or hire.\"With businesses shut, 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits over the past month. The jobless rate was forecast to soar to 13.7 percent in the current quarter, coming down to 11 percent in the third quarter and 8.5 percent in the fourth.In the meantime, the Fed's balance sheet rose to a record $6.42 trillion last week, a little under one-third the size of US GDP before the crisis struck. That jumped from just $4.29 trillion in the first week of March.It is expected to grow another $3.5 trillion to $10 trillion by the end of this year.Over the course of its response to the last global financial crisis that began more than a decade ago, the Fed's balance sheet expanded by a total of nearly $3.6 trillion to peak around $4.5 trillion.Twenty-three of 36 economists said the Fed was not done yet.

They have torn through large swathes of food crops in the Horn of Africa, where more than 24 million people are already \"food insecure\" and 12 million people are internally displaced, the Bank said in a recent blog posting.The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that 821 million people, or nearly 11\u00a0percent of the world population, are undernourished, the highest rate since 2011.Pangestu said the Bank, which is making $160 billion available to respond to the pandemic over the next 15 months, is working closely with countries and international partners to monitor food supplies, and how the loss of income is impacting people's ability to buy food.She said it was critical to leverage community-based groups to distribute food, and implement social protection programs for the world's poorest. Digital technologies could also help monitor harvest conditions and link producers with consumers.Up to 80\u00a0percent of the workforce in some of the poorest countries are both producers and net consumers in the agricultural and food sectors, she said, underscoring the need to make food supply a priority.\"Let's not repeat what happened in 2008 when trade restrictions amplified world food price spikes and caused 130-155 million more people to fall below the poverty line, especially in the most vulnerable countries,\" Pangestu said.G20 agriculture and food ministers agreed at a virtual meeting on Tuesday that emergency measures to contain the spread of the pandemic must not create \"unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global food supply chains.\""], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Economy#G20#Mari Pangestu#World Bank#World News"},

In Mumbai, this could range between Rs 4 lakh for a simple surgery to as high as Rs 50 lakh for advanced treatments like cancer.Health insurance policyholders may not immediately feel the pinch as product renewals are on a yearly basis. Once the new packages for COVID-19 are finalised between hospitals and insurers, new premiums could be applicable for customers next year onwards. Currently, there is no fixed COVID-19 package rates and treatment costs are being decided on a case-to-case basis.S Prakash, managing director of Star Health Insurance, told Moneycontrol that it (COVID-19 treatment) is not a regular surgery where a fixed amount is decided upon for a package.\u201cWe can fix a cost for room rent, personal protective equipment (PPE) and the type of treatment and number of days of treatment, and also decide on the criteria for admission, number of days of hospitalisation, criteria for discharge among others. This will ensure a fair pricing. A wide interaction between hospitals and medically qualified insurance professionals is required to reach a consensus. This will enable a sustainable pricing,\u201d he added.Unlike regular treatments, COVID-19 requires tests to be done multiple times. Plus, use of PPE kits on a daily basis and days of hospitalisation also influences the cost.Further, treatments like Convalescent Plasma Therapy and Monoclonal Antibody have also been identified for COVID-19. For instance, Prakash explained the cost for Monoclonal Antibody treatment costs between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh.Moneycontrol had  how hospitals are having to bear the additional cost of infection control due to COVID-19. These hospitals are now seeking higher limits under insurance for treating COVID-19 positive patients.\"This is different than regular hospitalisation cases. We have to see the kind of expenses incurred and then decide on the cost. It will be a continuous dialogue,\" said a senior general insurance executive.India now has a total of 17,265 COVID-19 reported cases. Of this, 14,175 cases are active, 2,546 have been cured/discharged, one migrated. The total number of deaths in India among these reported cases is 543.Industry sources said the government is also looking at bringing out certain treatment protocols and cost protocols. This will help pave the way for how insurance costs will be decided over the next few weeks.Under a regular hospitalisation cover, a set package rate is decided for each procedure. For instance, if an individual is undergoing angioplasty a set package of say Rs 4 lakh could be fixed that includes surgery, room rent, doctor fees and other medical expenses.The insurance regulator (IRDAI) has asked companies to cover COVID-19 hospitalisation under medical covers if the policy includes any type of hospitalisation. Further, IRDAI has said that insurers\u00a0have to\u00a0establish systems, procedures to enable efficient issuance of pre-authorisations on a 24-hour basis and for prompt settlement of claims.Further, IRDAI has said decision on authorisation for cashless treatment for COVID-19 has to be communicated to the network provider (hospital) within two hours from the time of receipt of the request."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#COVID_19#Economy#insurance"},

It compared with an initial extra budget worth 16.8 trillion yen.Reuters was the first to report the stimulus budget and bond issuance plans ahead of the official announcement.While the government boosts fiscal stimulus, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has also joined other central banks to roll out stimulus to stave off the risk of a global recession.The BOJ eased monetary policy last month by pledging to boost risky asset purchases and create a new loan scheme to pump more money into firms hit by slumping sales. The central bank will discuss further steps to ease corporate funding strains at this month's rate review as the impact hits profits.The government on the other hand will raise the market issuance of government bonds by 5.8 trillion yen to 152.8 trillion yen in the fiscal year to March 2021.The extra borrowing will add to the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden, which is more than twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy.It is rare for the government to compile an extra budget at the start of a new fiscal year, and it is even rarer to revise a budget draft that has been approved by the cabinet after coordinating closely with the ruling coalition.Last week, the prime minister, who has been criticised by some over his handling of the pandemic, apologised for confusion over a plan to start distributing coronavirus relief payments next month.The government is expected to submit the extra budget to parliament early next week, with the aim of gaining approval by the \"Golden Week\" holidays early May.More than 200 people have died from the virus in Japan, which has reported more than 11,000 infections, of which more than a quarter are in Tokyo."], "tags": "#Bank of Japan#Business#coronavirus#Economy#Japan#Shinzo Abe#World News"},

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investor investment is already capped at 9.99 percent - which is safe in nature.A source close to the development told Moneycontrol, \"We are just analysing data of investment especially from China, Hong Kong whether they have invested highly during the downfall - which is not in the alarming stage in listed companies as of now.\"A second source also confirmed with Moneycontrol, \"Seeking details from custodians is a routine process for surveillance, where they feel ultimate beneficiaries are not not clearly known. In the FPI regime. There are clear instructions that FPI can only get 9.99 percent of stake where there is no fear of takeover in distress conditions. Earlier, also, we sought data of European Union or Mauritius based trade.\"A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping in order to minimise the risk of their theft or loss. A custodian holds securities and other assets in electronic or physical form. Since they are responsible for the safety of assets and securities that may be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, custodians generally tend to be large and reputable firms. A custodian is sometimes referred to as a \u2018custodian bank\u2019. Basically, a custodian takes responsibility for FPI trade and settles their trade.\"China is an FATF-cleared country and in this category, and they do not come under any grey or black category. SEBI will not make any separate regulations for Chinese investment until the government of India takes any adverse stand for Chinese investment. SEBI and the government clearly made rules of FPI investment which permits Chinese to invest in listed space, \"said Tejas Chitlangi, a lawyer who deals with FPI registration.A third source close to the market told Moneycontrol. \" SEBI may use delay tactics for new FPI registration but not take any adverse action on investment of China and Hong Kong currently as regulations permit them to take a stake in stocks. SEBI may ask FPI who is buying whether they are buying for long term or short term. The surveillance department of SEBI may keep a watch for this type of investment.\u201dA fourth source from broking told Moneycontrol, \"There is no significant investment by companies from China and Hong Kong during the downfall in the market in March. Chinese investments do not come only through China or Hong Kong, they use the Singapore and the Mauritius routes as well for their investments. Even identifying ultimate beneficiaries in this case is also difficult. On the other side, the government relaxed the Mauritius route and allowed investment in FPI Category 1. Alibaba\u2019s investment in Paytm was by Alibaba Singapore Holdings pvt. Limited. These do not get recorded in India\u2019s government data as Chinese investments\".However, SEBI is analysing the data of another eleven countries including Mongolia, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Taiwan, North Korea, Yemen and Iran to find out if the Chinese investment used this route and took significant stake in the company.Another source who works in a Chinese broking firm in India told Moneycontrol, \"Chinese investment is high in technology firms, as well as in the infrastructure and pharma space, and mainly in the un-listed space. India's trade with China is the second largest worth of $87 billion in 2018-19, which is aimed to increase to $100 billion. In this, $70 billion is for import and $16.4 billion for export from India. FPI restrictions on Chinese investment may trigger only from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs - which is unlikely for existing investment since good diplomatic relations of both the countries.\u201dUnlisted investment does not come under the investigation part of SEBI which is dealt by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with consultation with the Ministry of Finance.As per Gateway House, the think-tank said in their report, \"China\u2019s economic footprint in India seems negligible compared to its presence in other emerging markets, especially in South Asian countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Whereas investments in these countries are mostly in physical infrastructure, the Chinese funding to Indian tech start-ups is making an impact disproportionate to its value, given the deepening penetration of technology across sectors in India. TikTok, owned by ByteDance, is already one of the most popular apps in India, overtaking YouTube; Xiaomi handsets are bigger than Samsung smartphones; Huawei routers are widely used.\u201dIt further said, \"Over the course of one year, Gateway House has conducted a deep study of Chinese investments in India as part of a larger research project on Chinese investments in India\u2019s neighbourhood. The findings are remarkable: 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns have a Chinese investor. This means that China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it.\u201d\u201cUnlike a port or a railway line, these are invisible assets in small sizes \u2013 rarely over $100 million \u2013 and made by the private sector, which doesn\u2019t cause immediate alarm. All this adds up to just 1.5 percent of the total official Chinese (including Hong Kong) FDI into India. This doesn\u2019t cover investments made by funds based out of Singapore and elsewhere, where the ultimate owner is Chinese, so the actual investment in India will be higher,\u201d it added.A source close to the development told Moneycontrol, \"India and China are part of BRICS bank. If India promptly restricts investments from any of these countries, it will raise concern of sustainability of this bank where they have heavily invested in these countries\".Earlier also, we have seen India's approach towards China which is not similar to other countries in the past as well, especially in the Huawei case. In this case, most countries took a stand against Hauwei but India did not take any adverse view on this country.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping have great chemistry as of now. After the visit of Xi Jinping, the Public Bank of China (PBOC) has opened its first branch in India and two other largest broking firms opened offices in Mumbai.Currently, we are importing around 70 percent of the API of HCQ from China which we are exporting to other countries. The Indian government is in touch with China for test kits of coronavirus for a large number of orders. A source close to development told Moneycontrol that, \u201cAt this point of time when we are more dependent on Chinese imports, it looks difficult to ban any of Chinese investment through FPI or FDI\".A source in the market told Moneycontrol, \" Despite that, we gave a clear signal by closing the automatic Foreign Direct Investment route from China that we do not want unrestricted money flow to India.\""], "tags": "#SEBI"},

The order, in effect, is a U-turn by the government within four days of it allowing web portals to restart full e-commerce operations from April 20, despite the coronavirus lockdown being in place until May 3.The policy move comes at a time when executives working from home and school students subscribing to online classes are facing an acute shortage of stationery, computers, phones, tablets and other devices.Here is the sequence of policy see-saw on the issue:Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 announced a 21-day lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of positive coronavirus cases in India.Through a series of orders in the last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April, the home ministry laid down the modalities of the lockdown by allowing only a limited set of commercial activities that included the delivery of all essential goods, including food, medicines, and medical equipment by e-commerce companies. The state governments and union territories were expected to adhere to these norms laid down by North Block.On April 14, PM Modi announced an extension of the nationwide lockdown until May 3 but promised select relaxations from April 20 onward. The idea was to allow a small number of economic activities in areas that were outside the containment zones or designated areas that were sealed by local authorities due to the high incidence of COVID-19 cases.On April 15, the home ministry modified its previous master list by laying down the protocol for allowing select economic activity from April 20.Clause 13 of this notification built upon the home ministry\u2019s previous lockdown guidelines by allowing all supply chain activity related to essential commodities, including for e-commerce retail. The government continued to allow brick and mortar stores to sell essential goods.But Clause 14 (v) of the same home ministry notification allowed e-commerce companies and vehicles of e-commerce companies to function from April 20. This effectively allowed home delivery of all essential and non-essential goods and services by e-tailers.A day before the relaxed guidelines were to come in effect, the home ministry again modified its April 15 master list. The April 19 order deleted Clause 14 (v) from the new guidelines. As a result, e-commerce companies will not be able to deliver non-essential goods like stationery, laptops, ACs to their consumers.There is no clarity in the home ministry notification on when e-tailers will be allowed to resume full operations.Brick-and-mortar shops from across the country closed ranks as soon as home ministry allowed e-commerce companies to commence full operations from April 20. Associations like Confederation Of All India Traders (CAIT) and Federation of All India Vyapar Mandal (FAIVM) claim to have reached out to the Prime Minister's Office, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal demanding that the government roll back the relaxation.These associations maintained that small retail traders dealing in non-essential items like consumer goods and electronics were sitting on summer inventory, and allowing only e-commerce companies to sell such merchandise during the lockdown period would crowd out the market for the brick and mortar stores.The government seems to have accepted the demand made by offline retailers for a level playing field. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal tweeted soon after the home ministry's order was made public.Goyal wrote: \"Grateful to Hon'ble PM @NarendraModiji for the clarification that e-commerce companies can only supply essential goods during the lockdown. This will create a level playing field for small retailers.\"Domestic retailers expressed their delight at this policy move. Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary-General of CAIT, said, \"CAIT demolished sinister plan of e-commerce companies to trade in non-essential commodities. Accepting the objection of CAIT, the MHA excluded the permission granted earlier and now e-commerce can trade only in essential commodities. Thanks to Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.\"The development will throw a spanner in the works for e-commerce companies, which were ramping up operations to prepare for the April 20 restart.Earlier this week, CNBC-TV18 reported Flipkart and Amazon's hiring of thousands of delivery and warehouse staff to scale up operations and fulfil orders of all products from April 20.Some companies had even started taking orders for non-essential goods such as mobile phones and refrigerators etc.States such as Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan had earlier put out their own rules stating that e-commerce companies will be able to move all goods starting April 20. Those will now have to be modified.A Snapdeal spokesperson said the e-tailer will continue to comply with the guidelines issued by the government.Suchita Salwan, founder, LBB, said that \"in times of uncertainty, the least we can expect from our policymakers is precise decision-making\"."], "tags": "#Business#Companies#coronavirus#E-commerce#Economy#India#video"},

While on a regular day, medical tests and several documents would need to be submitted to buy a policy, insurers are now waiving off medical tests and issuing policies after short video interactions.Purchasing a life insurance cover which is a must-have product for any individual with dependents at home, may also turn out to be cheaper since you would be buying directly from the company. This cuts down commission costs.Yes, you could buy a policy online but terms and conditions of a product are not always clear over the internet and savings-led insurance does require a few clarifications before a purchase decision is taken.On a regular day, buying an insurance policy would mean several trips by an agent to your home/office, discussing premiums and often the agent himself filling up the form for you after taking the mandatory signatures. There is also a likelihood of you being forced to buy a policy in haste or being asked to not disclose medical history.The most common advise given here being, 'just say you are a non-smoker'. Individuals who smoke are required to pay a higher premium or price for a life insurance policy since these persons are at higher risk than others. To sell a product quickly, agents often ask proposed policyholders to lie in their forms. Worse still, they answer all the questions on the policyholder's behalf.Now all those worries can be put away as insurance companies are directly selling products through their sales staff using video and telephonic interactions. Forms are filled live and your physical health and fitness is ascertained through a few questions asked by the sales persons.Remote working also means you do not need to wait for a weekend to call an agent home to discuss which policy is appropriate nor do you need to waste time during office hours filling policy forms with the intermediary.Given the uncertainty in the business environment and lack of clarity about when the lockdown will end, insurance companies are also keen to sell products with minimum friction. So it is unlikely that misselling would be done due to fears of potential customers dropping out.Compared to the pre COVID-19 era, the insurer will ask lesser questions and the only motive would be to suggest a policy that is best suited to your needs. So if you had a video-call at 9 am for buying a cover, it is likely that the policy cover will begin as soon as 12 noon on the same day.Over and above the need to buy term insurance, an added advantage is that you can also avail tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax (I-T) Act if premium is paid before June 30,2020. This can be used for filing personal I-T returns for FY20.From April 20, you would probably have a wide choice of non-essential items that can be brought through online platforms. This year, do yourself and your family a favour. Sacrifice that one device off your wishlist and buy a life insurance cover instead."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#insurance"},

In the current COVID-19 downturn, I find myself of two minds on this question. I thought I would share them both.THE PESSIMIST IN ME: Economic downturns are often highly persistent. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of turning points in the business cycle in the United States, has not yet declared that the country is in a recession, but it surely is. Like others, this recession may leave scars on the economy for years to come.THE OPTIMIST IN ME: Yes, the economy is often slow to recover from downturns, including the Great Recession of 2008-09. But this recession is different. It is occurring not by accident but by design. Employment and production are falling because we want people to stay at home.PESSIMIST: It sure is different. Look at the most recent jobs report. The employment-population ratio fell by 1.1 percentage points, the largest one-month drop since the data began in 1948. And that record will be broken next month, when the economic carnage of the last few weeks appears in the data. This downturn will be the deepest since the Great Depression of the 1930s.OPTIMIST: But the employment report also offers a glimmer of hope. The number of job losers on temporary layoff increased by a whopping 1.05 million, while the number of permanent job losers increased by only 177,000. That breakdown differs from the pattern in previous recessions, and it bodes well for a quick recovery. Those on temporary layoff can easily return to work when the lockdown is over.PESSIMIST: What makes you so confident that this will actually happen?OPTIMIST: Think about beach communities. Every winter, local restaurants and retailers close down. Every summer, when tourists return, these businesses ramp up quickly. The same can happen nationwide once people can leave their homes.PESSIMIST: Yes, but those businesses plan for the winter downturn. This downturn was unexpected.OPTIMIST: Or think about the return of veterans after World War II. The domestic economy absorbed all those new workers with ease.PESSIMIST: But many women who entered the labor force during the war subsequently left when the war ended, opening up jobs for the returning men. Nothing like that will happen this time.OPTIMIST: But remember, many people are on temporary layoff. Their jobs are waiting for them.PESSIMIST: Temporary layoffs can turn into permanent job losses if stay-at-home orders continue much longer and businesses become insolvent.OPTIMIST: But we seem to be turning the corner on the pandemic. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the daily number of coronavirus-related deaths in the United States may have peaked this past week, and we should soon be heading in the right direction. Daily deaths are projected to be close to zero by early summer.PESSIMIST: If the health situation is improving \u2014 and it may be early to say \u2014 the economic situation is not. Many people are still at home. When the draconian social distancing measures are relaxed so that normal economic life can resume, the health crisis could flare up again.OPTIMIST: With time, we\u2019ll find better ways to contain the spread of the virus than closing much of the economy. The key is widespread testing. If people were tested, say, every few weeks, regardless of whether they were symptomatic, the infected could be quarantined quickly, limiting the risk of contagion they pose to others.PESSIMIST: Tests for COVID-19 have been hard to get, and the wait for results has often been long, sometimes a week or more.OPTIMIST: The testing is improving. Some people can now get results in a matter of hours. The government will, however, need to invest much more in testing capacity for life to return to normal. We need tests to identify the currently infected as well as those who have recovered and have the antibodies, making them no longer vulnerable to the virus or a risk to others.PESSIMIST: Given the current dysfunction in Washington, counting on government seems like grasping at straws.OPTIMIST: The White House was caught flat-footed by the pandemic, and Congress is as divided as ever. But they still managed to pass an emergency fiscal package to meet the challenge. Most Americans got a tax credit, unemployment insurance was expanded, and small businesses were offered forgivable loans to help cover payroll and other expenses. And the law sensibly strengthened the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to act as lender of last resort.PESSIMIST: The fiscal package poses some big problems. For some people, expanded unemployment insurance pays more than their jobs did, giving them little reason to return to work. Not enough money was appropriated for small businesses, leading to a scramble to be first in line for funds. And some small businesses that don\u2019t really need the money will enjoy unjustified windfalls from these forgivable loans.OPTIMIST: The legislation was not perfect, but you can\u2019t expect perfection in a crisis. It was a step in the right direction, and our elected leaders deserve a lot of credit for it. Some of the flaws can be fixed in future legislation.PESSIMIST: All that creates a lot of uncertainty, which is never good for the economy.OPTIMIST: True, but uncertainty is inevitable during a crisis.PESSIMIST: At least there\u2019s one thing we can agree on."], "tags": "#Business#coronavirus#Covid-19#Economy#Features#Health#Lifestyle#news service#Science & technology#World News"},

Although, we expect that most of the funds may be channelized in the bond market initially given the credit risk aversion.Nonetheless, transmission effects will seep through gradually in the real economy.Another important announcement was the refinancing facility of Rs 50,000 crore made available to NABARD, SIDBI and NHB to ease financing constraints to sectors like agriculture, SMEs and NBFCs/ HFCs. This has a two-pronged benefit of firstly providing credit to sectors at the repo rate as against the market rate (which is ~250-350bps higher) and secondly, easing some supply pressure directly from the market.Meanwhile, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) reduction of 20 percent while should release liquidity of around Rs 6 lakh crore, we expect select banks which have statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) holding at the margin (including LCR required) only to be helped by the Reserve Bank's reduction in LCR. Additional liquidity may not necessarily flow into lending in the current environment.On the other hand, the success of TLTRO-2.0 still remains questionable. While the TLTRO will be HTM and hence not subjected to market risk, the credit risk still remains. There is therefore a need for authorities (maybe from the government's side) to announce incentives in the form of credit guarantees/first loss etc to make this option more attractive.Further, the increase in the WMA limit for state governments by 60 percent while may help them avert the tail risks in the auctions, the quantum (around Rs 20,000 crore incremental) may not be sufficient to address the supply concerns.Overall, the while the package-2 consists of several liquidity and regulatory easing measures (notably the NPA relaxation to 180 days), the bigger message by the RBI has been the open ended nature of the announcement and the willingness to do more to ease financial conditions to the relevant sectors and ease systemic risks.We continue to expect the RBI to announce more measures in the coming weeks with the next round largely focusing on the bond markets as they continue to reel under supply pressure hindering transmission. We can expect several forms of the announcement depending on the evolution of the economic stress going ahead like the relatively easy one should be a clear communication by the RBI on aggressive OMO purchases \u2014 maybe through a calendar.The central bank can also allow for HTM provisions for G-Sec and SDLs borrowed in Q1FY21 and also allow corporate bonds in repo.Eventually, under extreme stress, the central bank will need to explore direct monetization of government deficit and also purchases of distressed corporate bonds as unprecedented times warrant unprecedented actions."], "tags": "#Bonds#Economy#Expert Columns#RBI"},

In the first package both the government and the RBI provided a package which was less than 1\u00a0percent of GDP. In the second package, the financial package is just about 0.7\u00a0percent of GDP,\" the former Union minister said in a statement.\"The conditions in India are harsher than any other country. The government should understand the gravity of the present situation and the multiple dimensions of the present crisis,\" he said.Moily claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government have \"underestimated\" the damage caused to the economy and also the suffering of the people.\"There is a big loss of jobs to the extent of 35 to 40 million. There is a direct loss of Rs 15 lakh crore due to the present lockdown. According to Nomura, it is estimated to be 7.7\u00a0percent of GDP,\" he said.The collection of GST is down by 40 percent and the state governments which took the mantle of handling the present crisis including the issue of migrant labourers are left to fend for themselves, he claimed.\"The government should have ensured at least a package of 9\u00a0percent of GDP which works to Rs 17.5 lakh crore. What the government and RBI has done is only peanuts which will not allow the economy to stabilise forget about taking-off,\" Moily said.The RBI provided the second package to ease the liquidity, but it forgets that the recent merger of banks has demoralised the staff and officials and the banking machinery appears to have collapsed.\"State governments are not in a position to run normal budgetary programmes, forget about meeting the present war-like situation. The rural economy/agriculture has been totally paralysed,\" he said, adding that the state governments are not in a position to provide for any rescue operations.\"The country's economy has been put in a disastrous situation and hunger is haunting 60 percent of the country's populace,\" he said.The two packages announced reflect \"lack of both seriousness and sensitiveness\" of the government towards the plight of the people in the country.The government should also think of taking appropriate measures of tax exemptions for companies, relax regulations and also give up over regulation in the development sectors to ensure that the economy is put back on track, he asserted.Moily also suggested mobilising funds and restructuring of loans to help needy companies and SMEs.The RBI on Friday further eased bad-loan rules, froze dividend payment by lenders and pushed banks to lend more by cutting the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points, as it unveiled a second set of measures to support the economy hit hard by a coronavirus-led slowdown."], "tags": "#Business#Congress#coronavirus#Economy#GDP#India#M Veerappa Moily#Politics#RBI#Shaktikanta Das"},

With the health crisis likely to peak in April-June period, the expectation is that sales in the quarter will decline by as much as 40-50 percent.\"The worst case, as I see for the industry, is may be a 25 percent decline this year...the best case probably is 11 percent down,\" MG Motor India President and Managing Director Rajeev Chaba told PTI.Commenting on how he sees the industry coming out of the crisis, Chaba said, \"In April, May, June, my feeling is that in any scenario, industry will be down by at least 40 to 50 percent.\"Stressing on how crucial the April-June period is, he said, \"You will see more uncertainty...this is the time where you will see the peak of cases (coronavirus infection). Hopefully by June, we start seeing light at the end of the tunnel and we can see how this whole thing will be coming to an end. I hope we go through this quarter.\"Elaborating on the challenges ahead for the industry, he said, \"In July to September I would like to believe that the economy will start limping back to a new normal economy. Let's say 70-80 percent of normal or 50 percent of normal, and it will start limping back.\"So at that point of time, Chaba said,\"The huge issue for most of the industries, including auto industry is going to be harder to generate the demand, because most of the consumers may not be in the right frame of mind and are not going to buy things like car.\"At that point, he said, the question of demand stimulation will arise for which the industry would need government support.\"Here I think the government may have to move into the next mode. Also, along with that the industry as well as government have to do something on demand stimulation so that the customers are coming to a better frame of mind and they move on to new phase of their lives,\" Chaba said.When the festival season starts in September-October, Chaba said, \"Hopefully, we have come out of, the majority of the issues are over, still the virus would be there and precautions, everybody has to keep. That's the new normal. I think by festival time we would at least come back to the last year level but last year was already low base for the industry. At that low base we can come equal for the industry.\"According to industry body SIAM, in the fiscal ended March 31, total vehicle sales across categories in India were down 17.96 percent at 2,15,48,494 units as against 2,62,66,179 units in 2018-19.Similarly, passenger vehicle sales were also down 17.82 percent at 27,75,679 units in FY20 as against 33,77,389 units in FY19.Hoping that by 2021 things will be better for the industry, Chaba said,\"I think it should start taking off from January February onwards next year. So this is how I see it.\"On steps taken by the company to endure the impact of the health crisis, Chaba said, \"We are calibrating our business. We are doing a lot of planning and forecasting what can be the various scenarios of the market in the next nine months to 12 months. Accordingly, we need to have a new cost structure in place so that we can survive.\""], "tags": "#MG Hector#MG Motors India"},

Between April 1 to 17, FPIs pulled out a net sum of Rs 3,808 crore from equities and Rs 8,842 crore from the debt segment, the depositories data showed.The total net outflow stood at Rs 12,650 crore.However, April has been a tad better compared to March, when overseas investors had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian markets (both equity and debt).The quantum of net outflows has significantly slowed down, at least from equities, said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.\"Out of eight trading days so far in the holiday truncated month, FPIs were net buyers in the Indian equity markets in four,\" he said.Citing the reason for net inflows on some days in April, Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww, said \"global markets are becoming more stable. The general belief is that the virus has peaked in many parts of Europe which is aiding the sentiments of global investors. The oil deal between OPEC and Russia is also contributing to the relatively more stable markets.\"According to Srivastava, the widespread concern among foreign investors about slowdown in the global economy due to the COVID-19 outbreak has been keeping them on the tenterhooks.He added that slowdown in the quantum of net outflows in April does not indicate a change in the trend at this juncture as the underlying environment continues to be negative.However, he said this could be a result of India gaining prominence among foreign investors for doing well with regards to containing the pandemic.In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalise the sagging economy would also be resonating well with investors. The sharp fall in the markets has also provided investors an opportunity to invest at relatively attractive levels, he said.Going forward, Srivastava cautioned that \"there lies a bumpy ride ahead.\""], "tags": "#FPI"}
